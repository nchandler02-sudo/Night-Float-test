# UGIB/Variceal Suspicion

## Panic Card
- Airway first: prepare for early intubation if massive hematemesis, encephalopathy, or inability to protect airway; target **SpO₂ 92–96%** and avoid aspiration during RSI. citeturn2search38
- Two large-bore IVs or central access; initiate restrictive transfusion to maintain **Hb ≥7 g/dL** (higher if active ACS); correct shock to **MAP ≥65 mmHg** with norepinephrine if needed. citeturn2search48turn2search62
- Suspected variceal bleed: start octreotide now **50 μg IV bolus, then 50 μg/h infusion**; continue 2–5 days. citeturn2search31
- Start ceftriaxone **1 g IV q24h (up to 7 days)** for cirrhosis with UGIB. citeturn2search14turn2search29
- Call GI urgently for therapeutic endoscopy **≤12 h** once stabilized; consider balloon tamponade only as a bridge if exsanguinating and no immediate endoscopy. citeturn2search14turn2search2

## Brief Overview
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Stabilize ABCs, then prioritize vasoactive therapy and antibiotics before endoscopy in suspected variceal hemorrhage; this sequence lowers early failure and mortality. citeturn2search14
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use a restrictive RBC strategy with **Hb <7 g/dL** for most adults; consider **<8 g/dL** for pre‑existing cardiovascular disease. citeturn2search48turn2search53
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Initiate octreotide immediately when variceal bleeding is suspected: **50 μg IV bolus → 50 μg/h infusion** for 2–5 days; repeat bolus if bleeding persists early. citeturn2search31
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In cirrhotics with UGIB, give short‑course antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone **1 g IV daily**, typically **≤7 days**); reduces infections, rebleeding, and mortality. citeturn2search14turn2search29
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Perform therapeutic endoscopy once stabilized; for variceal source, band ligation is preferred; aim for **≤12 h** rather than ultra‑urgent <6 h if unsafe. citeturn2search14turn2search36
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Consider pre‑emptive TIPS within **72 h** for high‑risk patients (Child‑Pugh C <14 or Child‑Pugh B with active bleeding); improves 1‑year survival and reduces rebleeding. citeturn2search18turn2search44
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For undifferentiated UGIB before endoscopy, high‑dose IV PPI is reasonable; definitive ulcer care requires endoscopic hemostasis with post‑endoscopic high‑dose PPI. citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** in shock; norepinephrine first‑line, add vasopressin if needed; avoid excessive fluids once not fluid‑responsive. citeturn2search62
- What must happen now: establish access, send type and cross, resuscitate to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**, start octreotide + ceftriaxone, keep NPO, and notify GI for urgent therapeutic endoscopy planning. citeturn2search14
- What can wait: nonurgent imaging, H. pylori testing, secondary prophylaxis (non‑selective β‑blockers) until hemostasis is achieved and patient is stable. citeturn2search14
- Pitfalls: over‑transfusion raising portal pressure and rebleeding; transfuse conservatively and avoid chasing **Hb >7–8 g/dL** without compelling cardiac indications. citeturn2search48
- Pitfalls: routine FFP or platelet correction of cirrhosis‑related coagulopathy without specific indication; prioritize definitive hemostasis and avoid unnecessary volume. citeturn2search38
- Call ICU early for ongoing bleeding with pressors, airway needs, or high Child‑Pugh/MELD‑Na; anticipate need for rescue TIPS if endoscopy fails. citeturn2search14
- Balloon tamponade (Sengstaken‑Blakemore/Minnesota) is a temporary bridge when bleeding is massive and endoscopy unavailable; requires airway protection and careful monitoring. citeturn2search2turn2search12
- For non‑variceal ulcer bleeding, endoscopy **≤24 h**, endoscopic therapy for high‑risk stigmata, and continuous/intermittent high‑dose PPI x 72 h post‑hemostasis; antibiotics are not indicated unless cirrhosis. citeturn2search1
- Arrange secondary prophylaxis after control: non‑selective β‑blocker plus serial band ligation for esophageal varices; coordinate hepatology follow‑up. citeturn2search14

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent hemodynamic instability (need for vasopressors to maintain **MAP ≥65 mmHg** or lactate >4 mmol/L) despite initial resuscitation. citeturn2search62
- Ongoing hematemesis or failure to control bleeding after initial endoscopic therapy or need for balloon tamponade. citeturn2search38turn2search2
- High‑risk liver disease (Child‑Pugh C <14 or B with active bleeding) for consideration of early/pre‑emptive TIPS within **24–72 h**. citeturn2search18
- Need for airway protection due to encephalopathy or aspiration risk. citeturn2search38

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 56‑year‑old man with alcoholic cirrhosis (ascites, prior encephalopathy) presents with large‑volume hematemesis and melena. BP 92/56 mmHg, HR 118/min, SpO₂ 94% on 2 L. Hb 7.2 g/dL, platelets 98 ×10⁹/L, INR 1.7, lactate 3.8 mmol/L. He is awake and protecting his airway. Which next step is most appropriate now?

### Options
A. Start pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus then 8 mg/h and schedule endoscopy tomorrow morning  
B. Start octreotide infusion and ceftriaxone now; arrange urgent endoscopy within 12 hours  
C. Transfuse to hemoglobin 10 g/dL to prevent rebleeding  
D. Give FFP to correct INR to <1.5 before endoscopy  
E. Place balloon tamponade at bedside without airway control

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Early vasoactive therapy (octreotide) plus short‑course antibiotics (ceftriaxone) before endoscopy is standard of care for suspected variceal hemorrhage; urgent therapeutic endoscopy is generally performed within 12 hours once stabilized. citeturn2search14 A restrictive transfusion strategy of **Hb <7 g/dL** is recommended; routine FFP for cirrhosis‑related INR elevation is not advised in the absence of a defined coagulopathy needing reversal. Balloon tamponade is a bridge only when endoscopy is unavailable and after securing the airway. citeturn2search48turn2search38turn2search2

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 62‑year‑old man with HCV cirrhosis (Child‑Pugh C 11) presents with hematemesis. After fluids, he remains hypotensive (MAP 58 mmHg). Hb 6.9 g/dL, platelets 86 ×10⁹/L, INR 1.8. He is alert and cooperative. The team has octreotide and ceftriaxone running. Which action is best now?

### Options
A. Transfuse 2 units RBC to target hemoglobin 10 g/dL  
B. Start norepinephrine to reach **MAP ≥65 mmHg**, then arrange therapeutic endoscopy within 12 hours  
C. Administer FFP to correct INR before endoscopy  
D. Delay endoscopy for 24–48 hours to reduce aspiration risk  
E. Proceed with balloon tamponade now despite active resuscitation capacity and GI availability

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
In shock, prioritize achieving **MAP ≥65 mmHg** with norepinephrine while maintaining restrictive transfusion (generally **Hb <7 g/dL**, individualized if cardiac ischemia). Urgent endoscopy should follow stabilization; routine correction of cirrhosis‑related INR with FFP is not recommended without specific indications. Balloon tamponade is reserved for refractory/exsanguinating bleeds when endoscopy is not promptly available. The pitfall is over‑transfusion/FFP before definitive hemostasis. citeturn2search62turn2search48turn2search38turn2search2
