# Airway & Respiratory Failure (Non‑intubation Emphasis)

## Panic Card
- Apply oxygen targeting **SpO₂ 92–96%** (or **88–92% in chronic hypercapnia/COPD**) while monitoring **RR**, **mental status**, and **hemodynamics**; place patient upright.
- Start HFNC early for hypoxemic failure with high work of breathing: **40–60 L/min**, FiO₂ titrated to target; assess **ROX index** trends.
- Initiate NIV when indicated (e.g., COPD exacerbation with **pH ≤7.35** or cardiogenic edema): start **IPAP 10–15 cmH₂O / EPAP 5 cmH₂O**, titrate to **RR <25/min**, improved pH/PaCO₂.
- Treat underlying precipitants immediately: bronchodilators (albuterol/ipratropium), steroids for COPD/asthma, loop diuretics for pulmonary edema, broad‑spectrum antibiotics if severe pneumonia/sepsis; correct **MAP ≥65 mmHg** if shock.
- If deteriorating or contraindications to NIV/HFNC emerge (vomiting, inability to protect airway, facial trauma, refractory hypoxemia), prepare for definitive airway without delay; **Confirm Before Proceed** if giving neuromuscular blocker for RSI.

## Brief Overview
- Acute respiratory failure at night often benefits from non‑intubation strategies that reduce work of breathing and improve gas exchange while buying time for definitive therapy (diuretics, bronchodilators, antibiotics). Priorities: oxygenation targets, ventilatory support choice (HFNC vs NIV), rapid reassessment at defined intervals, and early escalation if objective thresholds are breached.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For COPD exacerbations with acute hypercapnic acidemia (**pH ≤7.35**, elevated PaCO₂), **NIV is first‑line** to reduce intubation and mortality; titrate IPAP/EPAP and reassess pH within **1–2 h** (GOLD 2024–25; ERS/ATS NIV 2017).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In cardiogenic pulmonary edema, **CPAP or BiPAP** reduces intubation and improves dyspnea rapidly; typical starting **CPAP 8–12 cmH₂O** or **BiPAP 10/5 cmH₂O**, alongside IV loop diuretics and afterload reduction when appropriate (ERS/ATS NIV 2017).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, **HFNC** at **40–60 L/min** with FiO₂ to SaO₂ target improves comfort and may lower intubation rates vs conventional oxygen; track **ROX index = SpO₂/FiO₂ ÷ RR** at **2–12 h** (ERS HFNC 2022).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use conservative oxygen targets: **SpO₂ 92–96%** generally; **88–92%** in chronic hypercapnia/COPD to avoid oxygen‑induced hypercapnia (GOLD 2024–25; BTS Oxygen 2017).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Severe pneumonia/sepsis with hypoxemia should receive timely antibiotics and source control; do not delay escalation to NIV/HFNC while antimicrobials are started; maintain **MAP ≥65 mmHg** if septic shock (Surviving Sepsis 2021/2023 updates; ATS/IDSA CAP 2019).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Objective NIV failure signals include **worsening acidosis**, **persistent RR >30/min**, **rising PaCO₂**, **SpO₂ <90% at FiO₂ ≥0.6**, or **intolerance/secretions**; escalate to intubation (ERS/ATS NIV 2017).
- What must happen now: position upright; set oxygen target; choose HFNC vs NIV based on failure phenotype (hypoxemic vs hypercapnic vs mixed); start disease‑specific therapy (bronchodilators, steroids, diuretics, antibiotics); place continuous pulse oximetry and frequent vitals; obtain ABG/VBG if hypercapnia suspected.
- What can wait 30–90 minutes: second‑line bronchodilators (magnesium sulfate **2 g IV** in severe asthma), broader diagnostics (procalcitonin, CT pulmonary angiography if stable), formal echocardiography after initial stabilization.
- HFNC pearls: Higher flows wash out anatomic dead space and provide small PEEP; ensure heated humidification to avoid mucosal dryness; use **ROX ≥4.88 at 12 h** as a favorable sign; trending matters more than one value.
- NIV selection: COPD/asthma with ventilatory failure → BiPAP; cardiogenic edema with shunt physiology → CPAP or BiPAP; set **IPAP to reduce PaCO₂ and RR** and **EPAP/CPAP to recruit alveoli**. Monitor for leaks, gastric distention, and pressure sores.
- Contraindications to NIV: **inability to protect airway**, **copious vomiting/aspiration risk**, **facial trauma/burns**, **severe agitation**, **hemodynamic instability refractory to initial support**, and **untreated pneumothorax**.
- Pitfalls: Excess oxygen in COPD can worsen hypercapnia; under‑titrated EPAP in cardiogenic edema fails to counter hydrostatic flooding; delayed escalation despite objective failure criteria increases risk. Avoid nebulizers that break mask seal—use inline setups when feasible.
- Call ICU early for: escalating FiO₂ needs (**≥0.6**), rising work of breathing with use of accessory muscles, **pH <7.25**, hemodynamic instability, or anticipated difficult airway. Early involvement reduces crash intubations.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For suspected pneumonia, follow ATS/IDSA 2019 severity criteria (e.g., **RR ≥30**, **SpO₂ ≤90%**, **multilobar infiltrates**) to guide level of care and antibiotics; noninvasive support does not replace timely antimicrobials.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In sepsis, avoid prolonged hypoxemia; prioritize **MAP ≥65 mmHg** with norepinephrine as first‑line vasopressor if needed; respiratory support choice should not delay antimicrobial therapy within **1 h** in shock (Surviving Sepsis 2021/2023).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Reassess within **30–60 min** after starting HFNC/NIV; if failing objective criteria, **do not delay** definitive airway. **Confirm Before Proceed** if considering paralytics for RSI after a failed NIV trial.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent or worsening hypoxemia: **SpO₂ <90%** despite **HFNC ≥50 L/min** with **FiO₂ ≥0.6** or NIV with **EPAP/CPAP ≥10 cmH₂O**.
- Hypercapnic acidosis: **pH <7.25** or **PaCO₂ rising** after **1–2 h** of optimized NIV settings.
- Escalating work of breathing/mental status decline (somnolence, agitation), or recurrent apnea.
- Hemodynamic instability or shock requiring vasopressors to maintain **MAP ≥65 mmHg**.
- Suspected contraindication to NIV (e.g., active emesis, facial trauma) or complications (barotrauma, pneumothorax).

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 68‑year‑old man with severe COPD presents with increasing dyspnea, somnolence, and wheezing. Vitals: T 37.0°C, HR 108, BP 152/86, RR 30, SpO₂ 90% on 6 L/min nasal cannula. VBG shows pH 7.28, PCO₂ 72 mmHg, HCO₃⁻ 33 mmol/L. Chest X‑ray shows hyperinflation without focal consolidation. After albuterol/ipratropium and IV methylprednisolone, he remains tachypneic and somnolent.

### Options
A. Increase oxygen to maintain SpO₂ 100% and observe  
B. Start high‑flow nasal cannula at 50 L/min, FiO₂ 0.8  
C. Start noninvasive ventilation with IPAP 12 cmH₂O and EPAP 5 cmH₂O  
D. Proceed directly to endotracheal intubation  
E. Give IV morphine for dyspnea and continue nasal cannula

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
In acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from COPD with **pH ≤7.35** and elevated PaCO₂, **NIV is first‑line** and reduces intubation and mortality (GOLD 2024–25; ERS/ATS NIV 2017). Excess oxygen (A) risks worsening hypercapnia; HFNC (B) is less effective than NIV for ventilatory failure; immediate intubation (D) is reserved for NIV contraindication or failure; opioids (E) risk hypoventilation without addressing hypercapnia.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 72‑year‑old woman with hypertensive cardiomyopathy presents with acute respiratory distress and frothy sputum. Vitals: RR 34, SpO₂ 86% on nonrebreather, BP 178/98, HR 122. You initiate BiPAP 12/6 cmH₂O and give IV furosemide. Ten minutes later she becomes nauseated with repeated emesis under the mask and increasing somnolence; SpO₂ fluctuates 84–88% despite FiO₂ 0.8.

### Options
A. Continue BiPAP and add antiemetic; reassess in 1 hour  
B. Switch to standard nasal cannula to improve comfort  
C. Stop NIV and start HFNC at 60 L/min; avoid intubation  
D. Remove NIV and perform rapid sequence intubation with aspiration precautions  
E. Increase EPAP to 10 cmH₂O and observe

### Correct answer
D

### Rationale
**Active emesis with inability to protect the airway is a contraindication to NIV** because of aspiration risk; escalation to **definitive airway** is indicated despite a general preference for non‑intubation strategies (ERS/ATS NIV 2017). Raising pressures (E) or waiting (A) increases risk; HFNC (C) does not address airway protection.
