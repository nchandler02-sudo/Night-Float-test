# Undifferentiated Hypotension/Shock

## Panic Card
- Assess airway/breathing; give oxygen to keep **SpO₂ ≥92%** (COPD: **88–92%**); place on monitor, obtain IV access x2 large-bore or central if needed; target **MAP ≥65 mmHg**.
- Begin **crystalloid 500–1000 mL** rapid bolus (sepsis: **30 mL/kg**) while sending STAT CBC, CMP, VBG/ABG with **lactate**, troponin, BNP, UA, blood cultures, EKG, CXR, POCUS.
- Start **norepinephrine** early for persistent hypotension (e.g., **0.05–0.1 µg/kg/min**, titrate to **MAP ≥65**); add **vasopressin 0.03 units/min** if escalating NE dose.
- If anaphylaxis signs: **epinephrine IM 0.3–0.5 mg (1:1000)** lateral thigh immediately; airway readiness.
- Treat reversible causes immediately (tension pneumothorax → needle decompression; massive bleed → **MTP**; pericardial tamponade → urgent pericardiocentesis).
- Confirm Before Proceed: thrombolysis, MTP activation, or emergent anticoagulation reversal only after verifying indication/contraindications.

## Brief Overview
- Shock is life-threatening circulatory failure with inadequate tissue perfusion; classify rapidly as distributive (sepsis/anaphylaxis), cardiogenic, hypovolemic/hemorrhagic, or obstructive (PE, tamponade, tension pneumothorax). Use vitals, exam (skin temp, cap refill), labs (**lactate ≥2 mmol/L**), and POCUS to steer therapy.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Surviving Sepsis recommends **30 mL/kg** IV crystalloid within the first 3 h for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion and maintaining **MAP ≥65 mmHg** with **norepinephrine first-line**; add **vasopressin** to reduce NE dose in refractory shock.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In cardiogenic shock, prioritize vasoactive support with **norepinephrine** for hypotension; consider **dobutamine 2–5 µg/kg/min** for low output with adequate BP, and escalate to mechanical circulatory support when escalating doses fail.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For anaphylactic shock, immediate **IM epinephrine 0.3–0.5 mg** is first-line; add aggressive fluids, **H1/H2 blockers**, steroids, and **nebulized bronchodilators**; refractory cases may need IV epinephrine infusion and glucagon if on beta-blockers.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Obstructive shock mandates procedure-first: **tension pneumothorax → immediate decompression**, **tamponade → pericardiocentesis**, **massive PE → systemic thrombolysis** if no contraindications or catheter/mechanical thrombectomy if available.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Pressor sequencing: **norepinephrine** first-line in most vasodilatory/cardiogenic states; **vasopressin 0.03 units/min** adjunct; **epinephrine** for refractory vasodilatory shock or anaphylaxis; **phenylephrine** reserved for specific contexts (e.g., tachyarrhythmias, RV outflow issues).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Lactate-guided resuscitation with serial checks every 2–4 h; decreasing lactate and improving capillary refill indicate improved perfusion; avoid over-resuscitation—reassess fluid responsiveness (PLR, stroke volume change) before additional boluses.
- Early bundle: monitor invasive BP if unstable, Foley for strict I/O, repeat labs including **lactate**, and source control (e.g., antibiotics **within 1 h** for suspected sepsis, drainage of abscess/empyema, remove infected lines).
- Use POCUS: IVC variation, LV function, RV dilation/D-sign (PE), pneumothorax signs (lung point/absent sliding), pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology; guide fluids and pressor/inotrope choice.
- Distinguish warm vs cold shock: distributive often **warm, wide pulse pressure**, low SVR; cardiogenic/hypovolemic often **cool, narrow pulse pressure**, low CO; treat the physiology, not just the BP.
- Pitfalls: excessive fluids in cardiogenic/RV failure causing pulmonary edema; missing hemorrhage (retroperitoneal/GI) in anticoagulated patients; occult adrenal crisis; failure to de-air lines causing air embolism; delaying source control.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Sepsis antibiotics: give broad-spectrum **within 1 h** after cultures; narrow with stewardship; typical adult dosing should account for renal/hepatic function and local antibiograms (use hospital-specific choices if available).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Shock targets: **MAP ≥65 mmHg**, **urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg/h**, mentation normalization, skin perfusion; avoid overshooting pressors causing ischemia; wean as lactate clears and perfusion improves.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Electrolyte safety: correct hyponatremia/hypernatremia ≤**8–10 mmol/L/24 h** (≤**4–6** if high risk); treat hyperkalemia in correct sequence—membrane stabilization (**calcium**), shift (**insulin/dextrose**, **β‑agonist**, **bicarbonate if acidemic**), remove (**diuretics**, **resins**, **dialysis**).
- Call ICU early for refractory hypotension, need for invasive monitoring/advanced airway/vasoactive infusions, or anticipated procedures (MCS, pericardiocentesis, thrombolysis) to prevent deterioration during transfers or imaging.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent **MAP <65 mmHg** despite **≥30 mL/kg** fluids or **norepinephrine ≥0.2–0.3 µg/kg/min** (or two pressors).
- Rising **lactate ≥4 mmol/L** or failure to clear by **≥10–20%** over 2–4 h with worsening perfusion.
- Need for invasive ventilation or escalating oxygen support (HFNC/NRB) with refractory hypoxemia or respiratory failure.
- Suspected obstructive shock requiring procedure (tamponade, massive PE with thrombolysis, tension pneumothorax).
- Cardiogenic shock with escalating inotropes/pressors, arrhythmias, or consideration for MCS.

- Order: Broad-spectrum antibiotics — {sepsis suspected; give within 1 h; choose per local antibiogram; adjust for renal function}
- Order: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) — {cardiac, IVC, lungs; evaluate LV/RV function, effusion, pneumothorax}
- Order: Lactate with serial monitoring — {now and q2–4h until <2 mmol/L or downtrending}

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 67-year-old man with diabetes and COPD presents with fever, confusion, and hypotension. Temp 38.9°C, HR 118, BP 78/46 mmHg, RR 26, SpO₂ 93% on 2 L. He received 2 L crystalloid, lactate is 4.8 mmol/L, and blood cultures were obtained. He remains oliguric. Which is the best next step?

### Options
A. Start dopamine infusion to improve renal perfusion  
B. Start norepinephrine infusion and titrate to MAP ≥65 mmHg  
C. Give additional 2 L crystalloid without reassessment  
D. Initiate phenylephrine as first-line vasopressor  
E. Begin dobutamine as sole agent to increase cardiac output

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Norepinephrine is first-line for septic shock to achieve **MAP ≥65 mmHg** after adequate initial fluids; vasopressin may be added if refractory. Dopamine increases arrhythmias and is not preferred; phenylephrine is not first-line in sepsis; dobutamine is adjunct when cardiac output is low but not sole pressor in hypotension.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 55-year-old woman develops sudden hypotension, stridor, urticaria, and wheezing minutes after receiving IV antibiotic. BP 72/40 mmHg, HR 96, SpO₂ 89% on NRB. She takes metoprolol for hypertension. IV fluids are running. What is the best immediate intervention?

### Options
A. Diphenhydramine IV and observe  
B. Epinephrine IM 0.3–0.5 mg to the lateral thigh  
C. Start norepinephrine infusion as first-line  
D. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium only  
E. Glucagon IV 1–2 mg without epinephrine

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Anaphylactic shock requires **immediate IM epinephrine 0.3–0.5 mg**, even in beta-blocked patients; glucagon is adjunct if refractory due to beta-blockade. Antihistamines and bronchodilators are supportive only and should not delay epinephrine; vasopressors are not first-line in anaphylaxis.

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions
- Q: What is the initial MAP target in shock resuscitation?  
  A: **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; individualize in chronic hypertension or cerebrovascular disease.
- Q: In septic shock, what initial fluid dose is recommended?  
  A: **30 mL/kg** IV crystalloid within the first 3 h, then reassess fluid responsiveness before more.
- Q: Sequence for life‑threatening hyperkalemia management?  
  A: Membrane stabilization (calcium) → intracellular shift (insulin/dextrose ± β‑agonist ± bicarbonate if acidemic) → potassium removal (diuresis/resins/dialysis).
- Q: Name one POCUS sign suggesting massive PE with RV strain.  
  A: RV dilation with septal D‑sign or McConnell’s sign.
- Q: When should vasopressin be added to norepinephrine in vasodilatory shock?  
  A: When escalating NE dose is required to maintain MAP, add **vasopressin 0.03 units/min** to reduce NE requirements.
