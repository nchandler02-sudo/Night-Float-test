# Community-Acquired Pneumonia

## Panic Card
- Assess ABCs; start supplemental O₂ and titrate for work of breathing; if shock suspected, initiate sepsis bundle: obtain lactate, draw blood cultures, give **30 mL/kg crystalloid within 3 h**, and start norepinephrine to **MAP ≥65 mmHg** if hypotension persists. citeturn2search12
- Start empiric antibiotics within **≤1 h** if sepsis or septic shock is suspected; avoid delays for imaging or labs once cultures obtained. citeturn2search12
- For non‑severe inpatient CAP without MRSA/Pseudomonas risks: give **beta‑lactam + macrolide** (e.g., ceftriaxone + azithromycin) or **respiratory fluoroquinolone** monotherapy; use **beta‑lactam + doxycycline** if macrolide/FQ contraindicated. citeturn2search2turn2search4
- For severe CAP or clear MRSA/Pseudomonas risk factors: add **anti‑MRSA** (e.g., vancomycin) and an **anti‑pseudomonal beta‑lactam** pending cultures, then de‑escalate. citeturn2search7
- Consider early HFNC/NIV for hypoxemic respiratory failure; intubate if worsening mental status, exhaustion, or refractory hypoxemia. citeturn2search12
- Confirm Before Proceed: Before fluoroquinolones or macrolides, review **QT prolongation** and drug interactions; avoid routine anaerobic coverage unless lung abscess/empyema suspected. citeturn2search18

## Brief Overview
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline is the core adult CAP reference; it updates diagnostics, empiric therapy, and severity assessment (replacing HCAP and emphasizing individual MRSA/Pseudomonas risk factors). citeturn2search2
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Determine site of care with clinical judgement plus a tool (PSI preferred) and identify **severe CAP** by 1 major (invasive ventilation or vasopressors) or **≥3 minor criteria** (e.g., **PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤250**, **RR ≥30**, **BUN ≥7.14 mmol/L**, **PLT <100 ×10⁹/L**, multilobar infiltrates, hypotension needing fluids, leukopenia, confusion, or hypothermia). These predict ICU need and mortality. citeturn2search10
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Diagnostic testing differs by severity. For non‑severe inpatient CAP, routine blood/sputum cultures and urinary antigens generally **not** recommended; for severe CAP, obtain **blood cultures, sputum Gram/culture, and S. pneumoniae/Legionella urinary antigens** before antibiotics when feasible. citeturn2search2turn2search7
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Start empiric antibiotics promptly. Non‑severe inpatient: **beta‑lactam + macrolide** or **respiratory FQ**; if macrolide/FQ not suitable, **beta‑lactam + doxycycline** is acceptable. Severe CAP (no MRSA/Pseudomonas risks): **beta‑lactam + macrolide** or **beta‑lactam + respiratory FQ**. citeturn2search2turn2search4
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Avoid routine anaerobic coverage in suspected aspiration **without** abscess/empyema; extended anaerobic coverage shows **no mortality benefit** and **higher C. difficile** risk. citeturn2search18
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Treat minimum **5 days** and reassess; ensure clinical stability (afebrile, HR/RR normalizing, hemodynamics stable, able to take PO) before stopping or switching to oral therapy. citeturn2search10
- Distinguish immediate vs delayed tasks: “Now” = stabilize ABCs, cultures (if severe), empiric antibiotics, fluids/pressors for sepsis, early oxygen/ventilatory support; “Can wait hours” = vaccine assessment, atypical/viral add‑ons, swallow assessment if aspiration risk after stabilization. citeturn2search12turn2search2
- Use MRSA nares PCR to **de‑escalate** vancomycin if negative and no other MRSA risks, per stewardship pathways aligned with 2019 guidance. citeturn2search7turn2search3
- Viral testing: when influenza/respiratory viruses circulate, test and **treat influenza** positives with antivirals; continue empiric antibacterials initially for inpatients given bacterial‑viral coinfection risk. citeturn2search4
- Legionella considerations: order UAT in severe CAP, outbreak/travel, or when epidemiology suggests; pair with lower respiratory **PCR or culture** when feasible to broaden detection. citeturn2search7turn2search20
- Procalcitonin: **do not** withhold initial antibiotics in clinically/radiographically confirmed CAP based on a low PCT; consider PCT trends only for stewardship after stabilization. citeturn2search26
- When to add MRSA/Pseudomonas coverage: prior respiratory isolation, or **recent hospitalization with IV antibiotics** (local risks matter). Reassess daily and narrow promptly if tests negative and patient stabilizing. citeturn2search2turn2search7
- Duration nuances: bacteremic pneumococcal CAP often needs **≥7 days**; Legionella typically **7–10 days** depending on agent/response—ensure clinical stability and source control. citeturn2search2
- Early mobilization, incentive spirometry, and DVT prophylaxis reduce complications; assess aspiration risk and perform swallow evaluation once stable. citeturn2search2
- Pitfalls: relying on “HCAP” label (retired), overusing broad antipseudomonal/anti‑MRSA agents without patient‑specific risks, and adding metronidazole/clindamycin for uncomplicated aspiration. citeturn2search2turn2search18
- ICU/consult: escalate early for rising O₂ needs (HFNC/NIV to invasive), shock, or ≥3 minor severe CAP criteria; involve ID/pulmonary for complex resistance, rapid de‑escalation, and ventilatory strategy. citeturn2search10turn2search12
- Discharge readiness: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, **SpO₂ stable on room air or baseline**, tolerating PO, and safe outpatient follow‑up; convert to oral agents with high bioavailability (e.g., levofloxacin, doxycycline, azithromycin, amoxicillin‑clavulanate) per susceptibilities. citeturn2search2

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Need for invasive mechanical ventilation or vasopressors (major criteria for severe CAP). citeturn2search10
- **≥3 minor severe CAP criteria** (e.g., **PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤250**, multilobar infiltrates, **RR ≥30**, **BUN ≥7.14 mmol/L**, **PLT <100 ×10⁹/L**, confusion, hypotension requiring fluids, leukopenia, or hypothermia). citeturn2search10
- Rising oxygen/ventilatory support needs (escalating HFNC/NIV) or refractory hypoxemia despite optimization. citeturn2search12
- Septic shock physiology (elevated lactate, hypotension despite fluids) or rapidly worsening organ dysfunction. citeturn2search12

## Orders to Place Now
- Order: Empiric antibiotics — {choose: ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h + azithromycin 500 mg IV/PO daily; or levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily; if macrolide/FQ contraindicated, ampicillin‑sulbactam 3 g IV q6h + doxycycline 100 mg IV/PO q12h}
- Order: Sepsis bundle — {lactate now and 2–4 h recheck if initial ≥2 mmol/L; blood cultures ×2 before antibiotics if severe; 30 mL/kg IV crystalloid; start norepinephrine if MAP <65 mmHg after fluids}
- Order: Microbiology — {sputum Gram stain/culture; pneumococcal and Legionella urinary antigens if severe; MRSA nares PCR to guide de‑escalation}
- Order: Respiratory support — {oxygen {device}; target SpO₂ individualized; consider HFNC/NIV if persistent hypoxemia or increased WOB}
- Order: Diagnostics — {CXR or chest CT if unclear; respiratory viral PCR panel during respiratory virus season}
- Order: Daily stewardship reassessment — {narrow/stop MRSA/Pseudomonas coverage if risk tests negative and patient improving; transition to PO when stable}

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 67‑year‑old man with COPD (on LABA/LAMA), HTN, and diabetes presents with fever, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and consolidation on CXR. He is hypoxic to 90% on 2 L but hemodynamically stable. ECG shows **QTc 510 ms**. No prior MRSA/Pseudomonas isolation; no hospitalization with IV antibiotics in the last year. You admit him to the ward.

### Options
A. Azithromycin monotherapy  
B. Levofloxacin monotherapy  
C. Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin  
D. Ceftriaxone plus doxycycline  
E. Piperacillin‑tazobactam plus vancomycin

### Correct answer
D

### Rationale
For non‑severe inpatient CAP without MRSA/Pseudomonas risks, **beta‑lactam + macrolide** or **respiratory FQ** are first‑line; when macrolide/FQ are **contraindicated** (here, marked QT prolongation), **beta‑lactam + doxycycline** is guideline‑supported. Avoid azithromycin monotherapy and broad anti‑Pseudomonas/MRSA agents without risk factors. Treat for **≥5 days** with clinical stability before stop/step‑down. citeturn2search2turn2search10

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
An 82‑year‑old woman aspirates during a syncopal episode at dinner. She has fever, cough, right lower‑lobe infiltrate, and needs 3 L O₂ by nasal cannula. No abscess or empyema on CT. No MRSA/Pseudomonas risks. She is stable on the ward.

### Options
A. Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin  
B. Ampicillin‑sulbactam plus doxycycline  
C. Ceftriaxone plus metronidazole  
D. Piperacillin‑tazobactam plus vancomycin  
E. Clindamycin monotherapy

### Correct answer
A

### Rationale
In uncomplicated aspiration‑associated CAP **without** lung abscess/empyema, routine **anaerobic coverage is not recommended**; standard CAP regimens (e.g., ceftriaxone + azithromycin) are appropriate. Extended anaerobic coverage (metronidazole/clindamycin or broad anti‑anaerobes) **does not improve mortality and increases C. difficile risk**—the pitfall is overtreating presumed “aspiration pneumonia.” citeturn2search18
