# Chest Pain (ACS/Post‑ROSC)

## Panic Card
- ABCs first: cardiac monitor, defibrillation pads on, large‑bore IV/IO; obtain 12‑lead ECG within **≤10 min** of arrival/chest‑pain report.
- Oxygen only if hypoxemic; target **SpO₂ 92–98%** (avoid hyperoxia), ensure **PaCO₂ 35–45 mmHg** if ventilated; maintain **MAP ≥65 mmHg** (first‑line norepinephrine).
- Give **aspirin 162–325 mg chew now** unless true anaphylaxis or active major bleeding; keep **NPO** for potential cath.
- Treat pain/ischemia: **nitroglycerin** SL 0.4 mg q5 min up to 3 doses if **SBP ≥100 mmHg**, no RV infarct, no recent PDE5 inhibitor; avoid routine morphine.
- Reassess ECG if pain persists; activate cath lab immediately for diagnostic **ST‑elevation** or new LBBB with ischemic symptoms.
- Confirm Before Proceed: fibrinolysis for STEMI only if PCI unavailable; verify absolute contraindications; typical window **≤12 h** (consider up to 24 h if ongoing ischemia or shock).

## Brief Overview
- Night priorities: rule in/out ACS rapidly (ECG **≤10 min**, repeat if pain continues), control oxygenation (**SpO₂ 92–98%**), stabilize hemodynamics (**MAP ≥65 mmHg**), give antiplatelet early, and decide PCI vs fibrinolysis vs conservative pathway.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** AHA/ACC 2021 Chest Pain guideline prioritizes rapid ECG acquisition/interpretation and hs‑troponin‑based algorithms (0/1‑h or 0/2‑h) for ED/inpatient chest pain; dynamic change plus symptoms elevates ACS probability.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For STEMI, emergent PCI is preferred (door‑to‑balloon **≤90 min**) or fibrinolysis (door‑to‑needle **≤30 min**) if PCI delay exceeds thresholds; avoid fibrinolysis if contraindicated (intracranial hemorrhage history, aortic dissection, active bleeding).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Oxygen is indicated for **SpO₂ <90–92%** or respiratory distress; avoid hyperoxia in ACS and post‑ROSC because it increases mortality/neurologic injury risk; target **SpO₂ 92–98%** and normocapnia.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Post‑ROSC bundle: secure airway/ventilation (PaCO₂ 35–45), titrate FiO₂ to avoid hyperoxia, maintain **MAP ≥65 mmHg** (norepinephrine first‑line), active temperature control to prevent fever (target **≤37.5°C**, many centers 36°C), glucose 7.8–10 mmol/L, and early neuro‑prognostication deferred **≥72 h** after normothermia.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Immediate angiography after ROSC is indicated for clear **ST‑elevation** or ongoing ischemia/shock; routine immediate cath for comatose post‑ROSC patients **without ST‑elevation** has not shown benefit—use a selective approach.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Antiplatelet strategy: **aspirin** loading universally (if no contraindication); add a P2Y₁₂ inhibitor (ticagrelor/prasugrel preferred over clopidogrel in PCI‑planned ACS) after cardiology plan is set, especially if urgent CABG is possible.
- Anticoagulation: **UFH** preferred in unstable patients or severe CKD/anticipated procedures; **enoxaparin** acceptable if renal function allows; monitor anti‑Xa/aPTT per protocol; avoid if dissection/major bleed suspected.
- Blood pressure/ischemia: give **SL nitroglycerin** if hypertensive and no RV infarct; for inferior STEMI with RV involvement and hypotension, give **250–500 mL** isotonic fluid bolus and **avoid nitrates**; consider low‑dose beta‑blocker if hypertensive/tachycardic and no signs of acute heart failure or shock.
- Pain control: prioritize nitrates and reperfusion; avoid routine morphine due to potential harm and delayed antiplatelet absorption; if needed, use the lowest dose with careful monitoring.
- What must happen now: ECG, aspirin, O₂ titration, hemodynamic stabilization, cath lab activation for STEMI, anticoagulation when ACS is likely and bleeding risk acceptable, POCUS for shock/source.
- What can wait (briefly): formal echocardiography (once stable), full secondary prevention regimen (high‑intensity statin should be started early but does not delay reperfusion), risk stratification scores, and detailed etiology workup (e.g., vasospasm, MINOCA).
- Pitfalls: treating all troponin elevations as type 1 MI; consider **type 2 MI** (supply/demand) and **myocardial injury** (e.g., sepsis, PE, CKD); integrate symptoms, ECG, and dynamics (rise/fall).
- Pitfalls: missing aortic dissection (tearing pain, pulse/BP differential, mediastinal widening) or pulmonary embolism (tachycardia, hypoxemia, D‑dimer/CTPA) where anticoagulation or thrombolysis decisions diverge.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Fibrinolysis absolute contraindications include prior intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke within 3 months, known intracranial neoplasm, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding; confirm carefully before administering.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Temperature control in comatose post‑ROSC: active fever prevention with target **32–37.5°C** per local protocol; avoid shivering; defer neuro‑prognostication **≥72 h** after rewarming/normalization.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use hs‑troponin serial testing (0/1‑h or 0/2‑h pathways) with sex‑specific cutoffs where validated; a single value below limit of detection with non‑ischemic ECG and onset >3 h can safely rule out in selected settings.
- Call cardiology stat for STEMI, persistent ischemia, hemodynamic instability, recurrent VT/VF, or cardiogenic shock; call ICU for escalating vasopressors, increasing oxygen/vent needs, or post‑ROSC coma needing temperature control.
- Confirm Before Proceed: before fibrinolysis/anticoagulation, screen for dissection, intracranial pathology, recent surgery, or anticoagulant use; document risks/benefits and contraindication checklist.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent chest pain with **ST‑elevation** or new posterior/inferior changes, recurrent VT/VF, or dynamic ST shifts with rising hs‑troponin.
- Shock or impending shock: **MAP <65 mmHg** despite fluids/vasopressors, **lactate ≥4 mmol/L**, or escalating pressor needs.
- Hypoxemia/hypercapnia requiring **FiO₂ >0.6**, high PEEP, or mechanical ventilation post‑ROSC; GCS ≤8 or coma needing temperature control.
- Suspected aortic dissection, papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal rupture, or new severe MR on POCUS—urgent cardiothoracic/cardiology consult.

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 62‑year‑old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents with 60 minutes of crushing chest pain. ECG shows ST elevation in II, III, and aVF. BP is 92/58 mmHg, JVP is elevated, lungs are clear. He took no erectile‑dysfunction medications. O₂ saturation is 95% on room air.

### Options
A. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin and start IV morphine  
B. Give a 250–500 mL isotonic fluid bolus and prepare for emergent PCI activation  
C. Start high‑flow oxygen to maintain SpO₂ at 100%  
D. Give IV labetalol to reduce heart rate and blood pressure  
E. Begin immediate fibrinolysis regardless of PCI availability

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Inferior STEMI with RV involvement is suggested by hypotension, clear lungs, and elevated JVP; the next step is **250–500 mL** IV fluid bolus and emergent reperfusion, avoiding nitrates which can precipitate shock. Oxygen is not indicated with **SpO₂ 95%**; routine morphine and beta‑blockade are harmful in hypotension. Reperfusion should be via PCI if available within guideline time targets; fibrinolysis is reserved when PCI delays exceed thresholds (AHA/ACC STEMI; AHA/ACC Chest Pain; ESC ACS).

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 58‑year‑old man is resuscitated from out‑of‑hospital ventricular fibrillation arrest. He is intubated, comatose, and hemodynamically stable on low‑dose norepinephrine. ECG shows no ST‑elevation. SpO₂ is 97% on 40% FiO₂. Head CT is normal.

### Options
A. Immediate coronary angiography for all post‑ROSC patients regardless of ECG  
B. Increase FiO₂ to 100% to maximize oxygen delivery  
C. Initiate active temperature control at 36°C, maintain **SpO₂ 92–98%**, and admit to ICU with selective angiography if instability develops  
D. Start routine morphine infusion for sedation and pain  
E. Begin fibrinolysis empirically for presumed occult STEMI

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
In comatose post‑ROSC patients **without ST‑elevation**, guidelines support active temperature control (fever prevention, commonly 36°C) and avoidance of hyperoxia while pursuing selective angiography if recurrent ischemia or shock emerges. The pitfall is assuming all post‑ROSC patients require immediate cath or 100% FiO₂; both approaches may harm outcomes unless specific indications are present (AHA ACLS 2020/2023 updates; Chest Pain/ACS guidance).

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions
- Q: Start oxygen if SpO₂ is 98% on room air?  
  A: No; avoid hyperoxia in ACS/post‑ROSC. Target SpO₂ 92–98% and titrate FiO₂ down when safe.
- Q: Initial inpatient aspirin dose for suspected ACS?  
  A: 162–325 mg chew immediately unless true anaphylaxis or active major bleeding.
- Q: Minimum MAP target during ischemic shock/post‑ROSC stabilization?  
  A: MAP ≥65 mmHg using norepinephrine as first‑line vasopressor if fluids insufficient.
- Q: When can fibrinolysis be given for STEMI if PCI is unavailable?  
  A: Generally within ≤12 h of symptom onset (consider up to 24 h if ongoing ischemia or shock and no contraindications).
