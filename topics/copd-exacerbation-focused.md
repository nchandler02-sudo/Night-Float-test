# COPD Exacerbation (Focused)

## Panic Card
- Titrate oxygen to **SpO₂ 88–92%** using Venturi or nasal cannula; avoid uncontrolled high‑flow oxygen; check ABG **30–60 min** after oxygen initiation. citeturn2search35turn2search26
- Start inhaled short‑acting bronchodilators: albuterol plus ipratropium via nebulizer or MDI with spacer; reassess work of breathing frequently. citeturn2search35
- Give systemic corticosteroid promptly: **prednisone 40 mg PO daily × 5 days** (or IV methylprednisolone if NPO). citeturn2search35turn2search20
- Initiate **NIV (BiPAP)** for acute hypercapnic respiratory acidosis (**pH ≤7.35, PaCO₂ >45**) with distress; prepare for rapid intubation if failing. citeturn2search15turn2search18
- If purulent sputum with increased volume and dyspnea or need for ventilatory support, start antibiotics covering common pathogens (e.g., amoxicillin‑clavulanate, doxycycline, or azithromycin per risk). citeturn2search35
- Confirm Before Proceed: Suspected pneumothorax or severe bullous disease with unilateral decreased breath sounds—obtain urgent CXR before NIV. citeturn2search35

## Brief Overview
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Define exacerbation as acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring change in therapy; common precipitants include infection and environmental triggers. Differentiate from mimics (PE, HF, pneumonia, pneumothorax). citeturn2search35
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Oxygen should be **titrated to SpO₂ 88–92%** to avoid oxygen‑induced hypercapnia; use Venturi for precise FiO₂; recheck ABG **30–60 min** after initiation to detect CO₂ retention and acidosis. citeturn2search35turn2search26
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** First‑line bronchodilation is short‑acting beta‑agonist plus antimuscarinic (e.g., albuterol + ipratropium) given frequently early, then spaced; transition to inhalers as patient stabilizes. citeturn2search35
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Systemic corticosteroids shorten recovery and reduce relapse; **prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days** is recommended for most inpatients; IV acceptable if NPO, but oral is effective when feasible. citeturn2search35turn2search20
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Start antibiotics for bacterial features (**increased purulence + volume + dyspnea**) or if **invasive/noninvasive ventilation** is required; typical options include amoxicillin‑clavulanate, doxycycline, or azithromycin with local resistance and QT risk in mind. citeturn2search35
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** **NIV (BiPAP)** is indicated for **pH ≤7.35 with PaCO₂ >45** and sustained tachypnea despite medical therapy—reduces intubation and mortality; closely monitor for early failure. citeturn2search15turn2search18
- What must happen now: secure IV access, continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry, early ABG/VBG, upright positioning, bronchodilators, steroids, judicious oxygen, consider NIV when acidotic, and early antibiotics if criteria met. citeturn2search35turn2search18
- What can wait until daytime: long‑acting inhaler optimization, inhaler technique education, pulmonary rehab referral, and smoking cessation counseling once stabilized. citeturn2search35
- Red flags tonight: **worsening acidosis**, rising PaCO₂, persistent hypoxemia despite oxygen, **altered mental status**, severe fatigue, **silent chest**, hypotension, or new focal consolidation—escalate care early. citeturn2search15turn2search7
- Pitfalls: over‑oxygenation causing CO₂ narcosis; missing pneumothorax or pneumonia; failing to escalate to NIV; excessive sedatives leading to hypoventilation; QT‑prolonging macrolides with baseline long QT. citeturn2search26turn2search15turn2search7
- Antibiotic nuances: tailor to severity and risks (recent antibiotics, structural lung disease). Reserve fluoroquinolones for severe beta‑lactam allergy or Pseudomonas risk due to adverse effects. Consider procalcitonin or CRP adjuncts if uncertainty. citeturn2search35turn2search40
- NIV pearls: start with IPAP/EPAP that unloads work of breathing; target pH improvement and PaCO₂ reduction; avoid in vomiting, facial trauma, or undrained pneumothorax; ensure rapid access to intubation if deteriorating. citeturn2search15turn2search18
- Coexisting pneumonia suspected? Apply **ATS/IDSA CAP** principles (imaging, risk‑based antibiotics) and reassess need for broader coverage; steroids for CAP are not routine unless another indication. citeturn2search7turn2search12
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For disposition, ICU if life‑threatening respiratory failure (e.g., **pH <7.25**, refractory hypoxemia, need for continuous NIV/IMV) or significant comorbid decompensation. citeturn2search35
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Arrange post‑exacerbation prevention: confirm vaccinations, assess eosinophils to guide ICS in maintenance therapy, address inhaler adherence, and consider pulmonary rehab referral. citeturn2search45
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Avoid routine theophylline or mucolytics for acute management; focus on bronchodilators, steroids, and targeted antibiotics per criteria. citeturn2search35
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In hypercapnic chronic CO₂ retainers, aim for **SpO₂ 88–92%** throughout hospitalization; document target in orders to prevent over‑oxygenation during transports. citeturn2search26

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Need for continuous NIV or **pH <7.25**, rising PaCO₂, or worsening encephalopathy despite therapy. citeturn2search15

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 72‑year‑old man with severe COPD presents with worsening dyspnea and productive cough. Vitals: RR 32/min, BP 146/84, HR 112, SpO₂ 86% on room air. After Venturi mask to 28% (SpO₂ 90%), he remains tachypneic and somnolent. ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO₂ 68 mmHg, PaO₂ 62 mmHg. Chest x‑ray shows hyperinflation without consolidation.

### Options
A. Increase oxygen to achieve SpO₂ 96–100%
B. Initiate noninvasive ventilation with close monitoring
C. Intubate immediately
D. Start IV furosemide
E. Give subcutaneous heparin therapeutic infusion

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
NIV is indicated for acute hypercapnic respiratory acidosis in COPD (**pH ≤7.35 with PaCO₂ >45**) and reduces mortality/intubation compared with standard therapy. Immediate intubation is reserved for failure or contraindications. Oxygen should remain **titrated to 88–92%** to avoid CO₂ retention. citeturn2search15turn2search18turn2search26

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 68‑year‑old woman with COPD on home oxygen presents with increased dyspnea and green sputum. In triage, a non‑rebreather at 15 L/min is applied; she now has SpO₂ 100% but becomes progressively somnolent. VBG: pH 7.25, PvCO₂ 80 mmHg.

### Options
A. Continue non‑rebreather and observe
B. Reduce oxygen to target **SpO₂ 88–92%** and start NIV
C. Administer naloxone
D. Withhold ventilatory support and give azithromycin only
E. Give IV bicarbonate

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Over‑oxygenation can worsen hypercapnia in COPD; management is controlled oxygen targeting **88–92%** plus **NIV** for acidotic hypercapnic failure. The pitfall is uncontrolled high‑flow oxygen causing CO₂ narcosis; antibiotics alone do not address ventilatory failure. citeturn2search26turn2search15
