# Alcohol Withdrawal & Agitation

## Panic Card
- Protect airway, breathing, circulation; place on continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry; target **SpO₂ ≥92%**, **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; treat hypoglycemia immediately—do not delay dextrose while you give thiamine. citeturn2search16
- Give thiamine early for Wernicke risk: **thiamine 200–500 mg IV** (suspected WE) before or with glucose; for prophylaxis **100 mg IV/IM/PO** if lower risk. **Do not delay glucose in hypoglycemia.** citeturn2search2
- First‑line sedation: symptom‑triggered benzodiazepines (e.g., **diazepam 10 mg IV q5–10 min** or **lorazepam 2–4 mg IV q10–15 min** to control autonomic surge and tremor). Escalate promptly if **CIWA‑Ar ≥19**. citeturn2search1turn2search16turn2search64
- If refractory after adequate benzodiazepines or when on ventilatory support: consider **phenobarbital load 10–15 mg/kg** (cumulative) or **dexmedetomidine infusion 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/h** as adjunct (not monotherapy). citeturn2search28turn2search25turn2search14
- Identify mimics/complications: sepsis, intracranial pathology, stimulant intoxication, hepatic encephalopathy, hypomagnesemia; correct electrolytes (Mg²⁺, K⁺, PO₄³⁻). citeturn2search1

## Brief Overview
- Alcohol withdrawal typically begins **6–8 h** after last drink, peaks by **72 h**, and may last **5–7 d**; severe forms include seizures (12–48 h) and delirium tremens (48–96 h). **Guideline Must‑Know:** Expect earlier onset if BAC falling rapidly. citeturn2search16
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use **CIWA‑Ar** in communicative adults to titrate meds; severity: **mild <8–10**, **moderate 10–18**, **severe ≥19**. High scores predict seizures/DTs; monitor at least q1–4 h early. citeturn2search64
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** **Benzodiazepines are first‑line** for moderate–severe withdrawal; use symptom‑triggered strategies when 24/7 assessment is available; front‑load diazepam for rapid control if IV access and no severe hepatic impairment. citeturn2search1turn2search2
- Practical dosing: diazepam **10 mg IV** q5–10 min until light somnolence and vitals stabilize, or lorazepam **2–4 mg IV** q10–15 min (preferred in **severe liver disease/elderly** due to no active metabolites). citeturn2search16
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In **benzodiazepine‑refractory AWS**, consider **phenobarbital** (e.g., **10–15 mg/kg** total load IV, divided) with ICU‑capable monitoring; avoid if heavy recent BZD exposure or suspected hepatic encephalopathy. citeturn2search28turn2search25
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** **Dexmedetomidine** may be used as an adjunct to control **tachycardia/hypertension/anxiety** when BZDs alone are insufficient; it **does not prevent seizures or DTs** and should **not be monotherapy**. citeturn2search14
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For intubated patients already on **propofol** or **midazolam** infusions, additional AWS‑specific sedatives may be unnecessary while on those infusions; continue thiamine and transition to BZD/barbiturate strategy as sedation is weaned. citeturn2search27
- **Thiamine**: give **parenteral thiamine** to malnourished, decompensated liver disease, ED attendees, or inpatients with acute illness; for **suspected Wernicke’s**, give **high‑dose IV for ≥5 days**, then PO. **Do not delay emergent glucose**. citeturn2search2
- Adjuncts: **beta‑blockers** or **clonidine** can blunt autonomic surge but **must not replace BZDs**; avoid routine **magnesium prophylaxis** for AWS itself (treat documented deficiency). citeturn2search14
- Antipsychotics (e.g., **haloperidol**) may calm severe hallucinosis **after** adequate GABAergic therapy; in ICU delirium, routine antipsychotics show **no clear benefit**; 2025 SCCM update issues **conditional** recs prioritizing **dexmedetomidine** over propofol when light sedation and delirium reduction are priorities. citeturn2search23turn2search24
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Evaluate for **co‑occurring SUDs** and initiate **AUD treatment** (naltrexone, acamprosate) when medically safe; link to services per **VA/DoD 2021 SUD CPG**. citeturn2search71
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In **decompensated cirrhosis**, avoid long‑acting, hepatically metabolized BZDs (diazepam/chlordiazepoxide); use **lorazepam** or **oxazepam** with careful titration and close monitoring. citeturn2search2
- **Confirm Before Proceed:** Large **phenobarbital** loads after substantial recent BZD dosing increase risk of oversedation/respiratory depression—review last **8–12 h** BZD exposure before loading. citeturn2search28
- Pitfalls: undertreatment leading to escalating agitation; mistaking **sepsis, thyrotoxicosis, stimulant intoxication, or CNS lesions** for withdrawal; missing **electrolyte derangements** (Mg²⁺, K⁺, PO₄³⁻) that worsen arrhythmia/seizure risk. citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Consider **front‑loading** strategies to reduce total BZD dose and ICU transfers; symptom‑triggered regimens reduce cumulative sedative use and LOS when implemented correctly. citeturn2search1turn2search16
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use **CIWA‑Ar alternatives** (e.g., **mMINDS**) for non‑communicative or ICU patients; don’t rely on CIWA in intubated or delirious patients. citeturn2search64
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Avoid **phenytoin** for AWS seizures; use **lorazepam** as rapid‑acting therapy and review the regimen. citeturn2search2
- Disposition: escalate to ICU for **refractory agitation, escalating sedative needs, respiratory compromise, or delirium tremens**; implement PADIS‑aligned light‑sedation strategies and early mobilization when safe. citeturn2search19turn2search23

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent **CIWA‑Ar ≥19** or need for **>40 mg diazepam equivalents within 1–2 h** to control symptoms. citeturn2search64turn2search16
- Recurrent seizures, evolving **delirium tremens**, or severe autonomic instability (**HR >120**, **SBP >180**, **T ≥38.5°C**) despite therapy. citeturn2search16
- Hypoventilation/aspiration risk, need for continuous infusions (dexmedetomidine/propofol) or **phenobarbital load ≥10 mg/kg** with close cardiorespiratory monitoring. citeturn2search25turn2search14

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 52‑year‑old man with alcohol use disorder is 12 hours after his last drink. He is anxious, diaphoretic, and tremulous with HR 122/min, BP 168/92 mmHg, T 37.9°C. CIWA‑Ar is 21. No focal deficits. Labs: Na 138 mmol/L, K 3.6 mmol/L, Mg 0.58 mmol/L (1.4 mg/dL), glucose 6.3 mmol/L. He is not cirrhotic. Best next step?

### Options
A. Start haloperidol 5 mg IV and observe  
B. Begin dexmedetomidine 0.4 mcg/kg/h infusion as monotherapy  
C. Give diazepam 10 mg IV now and repeat q5–10 min to symptom control  
D. Administer phenytoin 20 mg/kg IV for seizure prophylaxis  
E. Start chlordiazepoxide 50 mg PO scheduled q6h

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
Benzodiazepines are **first‑line** for moderate–severe alcohol withdrawal; in the ED/inpatient setting, IV **diazepam 10 mg** can be rapidly titrated to control autonomic hyperactivity and prevent progression. Dexmedetomidine is an **adjunct** only and does not prevent seizures; antipsychotics do not treat AWS and may lower seizure threshold; phenytoin is **not recommended** for AWS seizures; PO chlordiazepoxide is slower onset and less suitable when **CIWA‑Ar ≥19**. citeturn2search1turn2search14turn2search2

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 58‑year‑old man with decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, INR 1.8, bilirubin 58 μmol/L) is 16 hours after last drink with agitation, tremor, and hallucinations. HR 118/min, BP 160/88 mmHg. CIWA‑Ar 20. Which initial medication strategy is best?

### Options
A. Diazepam 10 mg IV q5–10 min to sedation  
B. Lorazepam 2–4 mg IV q10–15 min with careful titration  
C. Chlordiazepoxide 100 mg PO once, then q6h  
D. Phenobarbital 10 mg/kg IV load as monotherapy  
E. Haloperidol 5 mg IV q4h scheduled

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
In **decompensated liver disease**, choose intermediate/short‑acting BZDs without active metabolites (e.g., **lorazepam**) and titrate carefully; avoid diazepam/chlordiazepoxide due to hepatic accumulation. Phenobarbital may be used adjunctively in refractory cases but is not first‑line and poses oversedation risk in hepatic impairment—the **pitfall** is using long‑acting or barbiturate monotherapy in cirrhosis. Antipsychotics do not treat the underlying withdrawal. citeturn2search2turn2search1

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions
- Q: What **CIWA‑Ar** score defines severe withdrawal requiring aggressive therapy?  
  A: **≥19** indicates severe AWS and warrants rapid escalation and close monitoring. citeturn2search64
- Q: What’s a typical **phenobarbital** cumulative loading target in refractory AWS?  
  A: **10–15 mg/kg IV** (ideal or actual body weight per protocol), given with continuous monitoring. citeturn2search25turn2search28
- Q: Can **dexmedetomidine** replace benzodiazepines for AWS?  
  A: No; it is an **adjunct** for autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety and **does not** prevent seizures or DTs. citeturn2search14
- Q: In suspected **Wernicke’s**, how long should parenteral thiamine be continued?  
  A: For a **minimum of 5 days**, then transition to oral therapy. citeturn2search2
