# Decompensated Heart Failure

## Panic Card
- Elevate HOB, monitor, IV access, supplemental O₂ to maintain **SpO₂ ≥92%** (use **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia risk); start **NIV (BiPAP/CPAP) immediately** for severe dyspnea/flash edema.
- If SBP >**110 mmHg** with pulmonary edema: start **IV nitroglycerin 40–80 mcg/min**, titrate q3–5 min; add **IV loop diuretic 1–2.5× home oral daily dose (IV equivalent)**.
- If hypotension/shock: aim **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; start **norepinephrine** if needed; add **dobutamine 2–5 mcg/kg/min** for low-output signs; avoid large fluid boluses unless clear RV failure.
- Place Foley for strict I&O; target early urine output **≥150–200 mL/h** after diuretic dose; reassess lungs, BP, and urine q15–30 min.
- Treat precipitants now: ACS (ECG, troponin), tachyarrhythmia (rate/rhythm control), hypertensive crisis, infection.
- Confirm Before Proceed: invasive lines, intubation, or mechanical circulatory support should follow team discussion and indication verification.

## Brief Overview
- Acute decompensated HF (ADHF) is a spectrum from hypertensive flash pulmonary edema to cardiogenic shock; early trajectory depends on blood pressure, perfusion, and congestion phenotype. **Guideline Must‑Know:** Initial IV loop diuretic dose should be **1–2.5× the patient’s total daily oral loop diuretic (IV equivalent)**, then reassess diuresis within **2–6 h** (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** If **SBP >110 mmHg** with severe pulmonary edema, prioritize **vasodilators (IV nitroglycerin 40–200 mcg/min or nitroprusside)** plus NIV; this often relieves dyspnea faster than diuretic alone and can avert intubation (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022; ESC 2021).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In suspected cardiogenic shock, target **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; use **norepinephrine** as first‑line vasopressor and add **inotrope (dobutamine or milrinone)** for hypoperfusion with low output (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022; SCAI shock consensus).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Early noninvasive ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) reduces work of breathing and improves oxygenation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema; use unless contraindicated (ERS/ATS NIV guideline).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Diuretic resistance warrants stepped pharmacologic therapy: escalate loop dose, consider continuous infusion, and add thiazide‑type synergy (**chlorothiazide 500 mg IV** or **metolazone 2.5–5 mg PO**), while monitoring **K⁺/Mg²⁺/Na⁺** and renal function (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Avoid routine morphine; it may worsen outcomes via respiratory depression and hypotension. Reserve for refractory anxiety after other measures (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022).
- Assess precipitants that change management now: **ACS**, tachyarrhythmia (AF with RVR), hypertensive crisis, medication nonadherence, high salt/fluid intake, infection, PE, thyroid disease, cardiorenal syndrome.
- What must happen now: stabilize airway/breathing/circulation, apply NIV if needed, start appropriate **vasodilator** (if hypertensive) or **pressor/inotrope** (if shock), give adequate **IV loop diuretic**, place Foley for strict I&O, obtain ECG/troponin/CXR/BMP/BNP, and identify a precipitant.
- What can wait hours: full echocardiography (unless shock/new murmur), GDMT titration beyond urgent holds/resumptions, sodium restriction counseling, advanced device discussions unless ongoing shock.
- Pitfalls: underdosing loop diuretic initially; giving large fluid boluses in left‑sided HF without clear RV failure; delaying vasodilator in hypertensive pulmonary edema; withholding diuretics due to rising creatinine despite congestion (cardiorenal syndrome).
- Oxygen strategy: target **SpO₂ ≥92%**; in chronic hypercapnic respiratory disease use **88–92%** and prefer NIV if work of breathing high.
- Vasodilators: **nitroglycerin** is first‑line for hypertensive pulmonary edema (start **40–80 mcg/min**, titrate rapidly); **nitroprusside** for severe afterload excess under ICU monitoring; avoid if **severe AS** or **RV infarction**. Monitor for hypotension.
- Diuretics: common starting **furosemide 40–80 mg IV** if diuretic‑naïve, or **2–2.5×** home oral dose as IV; aim **net −1 to −2 L/day** and early **urine ≥150–200 mL/h**; check BMP **q6–12 h** and re‑dose based on response.
- Inotropes: consider **dobutamine 2–20 mcg/kg/min** (short half‑life, tachyarrhythmia risk) or **milrinone 0.125–0.375 mcg/kg/min** (no bolus; watch **hypotension/renal clearance**) when hypoperfusion persists despite decongestion and MAP support.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Continue guideline‑directed medical therapy if hemodynamically stable; hold **beta‑blocker** temporarily in shock or severe fluid overload with low output; hold **RAASi/ARNI/MRA** for **K⁺ >5.5 mmol/L**, **Cr rise >30–50%**, or symptomatic hypotension; SGLT2 inhibitors can often be continued or initiated when stable (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Ultrafiltration is not first‑line for cardiorenal syndrome; reserve for refractory congestion after stepped pharmacologic diuresis fails (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Identify right‑sided or RV‑predominant failure (clear lungs, JVP high, hypotension); avoid aggressive vasodilators and consider cautious preload support while treating precipitant (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022).
- Safety guardrails: maintain **K⁺ 4.0–5.0 mmol/L**, **Mg²⁺ ≥2.0 mg/dL**; avoid **Na⁺ correction >8–10 mmol/L per 24 h** if hyponatremic; monitor for **ototoxicity** with very high loop doses; use **heparin prophylaxis** unless contraindicated.
- Consults to consider: Cardiology for shock/ischemia/advanced therapies; ICU for escalating oxygen/pressors; Nephrology for refractory congestion or AKI; Electrophysiology for unstable arrhythmias.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent or worsening hypoxemia needing **NIV with FiO₂ ≥0.6** or impending intubation despite therapy.
- **MAP <65 mmHg** or rising lactate **>2–4 mmol/L** despite initial resuscitation and vasodilator/diuretic strategy.
- Sustained ventricular arrhythmia, high‑grade AV block with instability, or new ischemic ECG changes with hemodynamic compromise.
- Oliguria **<0.5 mL/kg/h** with **creatinine rise ≥0.5 mg/dL** in 24 h despite stepped diuresis and hemodynamic optimization.
- Suspected mechanical complication (acute MR/VSD) or need for mechanical circulatory support.

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 62‑year‑old with hypertension and known HFrEF (EF 30%) presents with acute severe dyspnea, pink frothy sputum, BP 190/110 mmHg, HR 120, RR 32, SpO₂ 86% on room air, diffuse rales, and no peripheral edema. ECG shows sinus tachycardia without ischemia. He takes furosemide 40 mg PO daily at home. CXR shows alveolar edema.

### Options
A. Give 500 mL normal saline bolus, then start dobutamine
B. Start high‑flow oxygen by nasal cannula and low‑dose morphine
C. Initiate BiPAP and start IV nitroglycerin infusion, then give IV loop diuretic at 80–100 mg
D. Start nitroprusside infusion only; avoid diuretics initially
E. Give his home furosemide dose (40 mg IV) and observe

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
Hypertensive acute pulmonary edema is afterload‑driven; immediate **NIV** plus **rapidly titrated IV nitroglycerin** relieves congestion, followed by adequate **IV loop diuretic (≥2× home oral dose as IV)**. Saline bolus and morphine are harmful; nitroprusside may be used in ICU but nitroglycerin is appropriate and readily available. Guidelines emphasize vasodilator‑first strategy when **SBP >110 mmHg** (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022; ESC 2021).

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 74‑year‑old with chronic HFrEF (EF 25%) and CKD stage 4 (baseline creatinine 2.8 mg/dL) is admitted for edema, orthopnea, JVP 12 cm, crackles, and weight gain 5 kg. BP 118/72 mmHg, MAP 87, HR 92, SpO₂ 94% on 2 L. After **furosemide 120 mg IV**, urine output is 60 mL/h and creatinine rises to 3.4 mg/dL. He is comfortable, warm, and not hypotensive.

### Options
A. Stop diuretics due to AKI and give 1 L normal saline
B. Continue current dose and recheck BMP tomorrow
C. Escalate diuresis with higher loop dose or continuous infusion and add metolazone 2.5–5 mg PO, with electrolyte monitoring
D. Start ultrafiltration now because creatinine increased
E. Start dobutamine for renal perfusion despite stable BP

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
This is congestive **cardiorenal syndrome**; the pitfall is **withholding decongestion due to creatinine rise**. Guidelines recommend stepped pharmacologic diuresis (escalated loop ± thiazide synergy) before considering ultrafiltration; inotropes are not indicated without hypoperfusion. Monitor **K⁺/Mg²⁺/Na⁺** and renal function closely (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022).
