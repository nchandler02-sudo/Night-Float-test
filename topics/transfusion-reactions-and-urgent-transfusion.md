# Transfusion Reactions & Urgent Transfusion

## Panic Card
- Stop transfusion immediately; keep IV line open with 0.9% saline; perform ABCs; place on monitor; target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** and **SpO₂ 92–96%**.
- Verify patient ID and unit numbers; send bag/tubing to blood bank; draw post‑reaction specimens (EDTA + clotted) for **DAT, hemolysis labs, repeat type/screen**.
- For anaphylaxis: give **epinephrine 0.3–0.5 mg IM** (1 mg/mL), airway/oxygen, IV fluids; add H1/H2 blocker and steroids after epinephrine.
- For suspected acute hemolysis (fever, back/chest pain, hemoglobinuria, hypotension/DIC): aggressive isotonic fluids, maintain **UOP ≥1 mL/kg/h**, early vasopressors if needed, labs for DIC.
- Massive bleeding/instability: activate MTP; give RBC:plasma:platelets in balanced ratios; **warm all products**; give **calcium** to counter citrate; obtain fibrinogen and consider **cryo if fibrinogen <1.5–2.0 g/L**.
- Confirm Before Proceed: emergency‑release uncrossmatched blood and Rh selection (O‑negative for females of childbearing potential) are high‑impact decisions—double‑check indication and documentation.

## Brief Overview
- Transfusion reactions cluster into acute hemolytic, febrile nonhemolytic, allergic (urticaria → anaphylaxis), TRALI, TACO, bacterial contamination/sepsis, and delayed hemolytic; initial steps are the same: stop transfusion, maintain IV with saline, re‑ID, and notify blood bank promptly.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** AABB recommends restrictive RBC thresholds (e.g., **Hb <7 g/dL** in stable adults, higher in ACS/neurologic injury); transfuse **1 unit → ~1 g/dL (10 g/L)** rise; reassess after each unit.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For emergency release, type O RBC is acceptable; choose **O‑negative** for females of childbearing potential and **O‑positive** may be used for adult males/post‑menopausal females if inventory is constrained.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** TRALI presents within **≤6 h** with acute hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates, and noncardiogenic edema; management is supportive (oxygen/ventilation); do not give diuretics for TRALI.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** TACO is hydrostatic pulmonary edema within **≤6 h** with hypertension, JVP elevation, BNP rise; treat with **IV loop diuretics**, oxygen, and slow future transfusions with volume management.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Acute hemolytic reaction (often ABO) features fever, flank/back pain, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, DAT positive; treat with fluids, maintain **UOP ≥1 mL/kg/h**, correct coagulopathy, pressors for **MAP ≥65 mmHg**.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For anaphylaxis during transfusion, the first‑line therapy is **IM epinephrine 0.3–0.5 mg**, airway/oxygen/fluids; consider IgA deficiency if severe; future transfusions may need washed/IgA‑deficient products.
- Febrile nonhemolytic reaction: fever/rigors without hemolysis; after evaluation and exclusion of serious causes, antipyretics may be used; resume only if reaction workup and clinical assessment support safety.
- Suspect bacterial contamination with severe fever, rigors, hypotension early in platelet transfusion or after any product; obtain blood cultures, start **broad‑spectrum antibiotics**, and culture the product via blood bank.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In massive hemorrhage, activate MTP early; use balanced resuscitation (e.g., RBC:plasma:platelets approximating **1:1:1** or viscoelastic‑guided); **warm products** and monitor **ionized calcium** and **fibrinogen**.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Plasma dose **10–15 mL/kg** for coagulopathy; cryoprecipitate (10‑unit pool) typically raises fibrinogen by **~100 mg/dL (~1 g/L)**; target **fibrinogen ≥1.5–2.0 g/L** in hemorrhage.
- Platelet transfusion: one apheresis unit raises count by **~30–50 ×10⁹/L**; transfuse if **<10 ×10⁹/L** prophylactically, or **<50 ×10⁹/L** with active bleeding/procedure (higher for CNS/ocular).
- Distinguish TRALI vs TACO using timing, hemodynamics, BNP, and echo when feasible; both require oxygen and monitoring; ICU if escalating oxygen/vent needs or shock.
- What must happen now: stop transfusion, stabilize ABCs, notify blood bank, send reaction workup, start syndrome‑specific therapy (epi for anaphylaxis, diuretics for TACO, fluids/pressors for hemolysis, antibiotics if sepsis).
- What can wait: secondary testing (e.g., extended antigen workups), long‑term alloimmunization prevention strategy, and outpatient follow‑up documentation once the patient stabilizes.
- Pitfalls: continuing transfusion after “just giving acetaminophen” without excluding hemolysis; mislabeling TRALI as TACO (or vice versa); failing to give O‑negative emergency blood to a woman of childbearing potential; neglecting calcium during MTP.
- Confirm Before Proceed: thrombolytics for hemorrhagic shock from non‑thrombotic causes are inappropriate; emergency‑release uncrossmatched units require explicit documentation of risk acceptance and prompt post‑issue compatibility testing.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent or worsening hypoxemia (e.g., **SpO₂ <90%** on high‑flow oxygen) or need for noninvasive/invasive ventilation after suspected TRALI/TACO.
- Hemodynamic instability or shock requiring vasopressors after suspected hemolytic reaction or septic transfusion reaction.
- Massive hemorrhage with ongoing transfusion requirement despite MTP, **lactate rising**, or **fibrinogen <1.5 g/L** refractory to cryo.
- Overt DIC or multiorgan dysfunction (AKI, altered mental status) associated with a transfusion reaction.

## Orders to Place Now
- Order: Transfusion reaction workup — {patient identifiers, unit number(s), pre/post specimens, DAT, hemolysis panel, repeat type and screen}
- Order: Hold and return implicated blood product to blood bank — {unit number(s), tubing attached}
- Order: Epinephrine IM — {0.3–0.5 mg of 1 mg/mL, lateral thigh, repeat q5–15 min as needed}
- Order: Massive transfusion protocol activation — {yes; notify lab/blood bank; goal RBC:plasma:platelets ≈1:1:1; include cryoprecipitate per fibrinogen}
- Order: Emergency‑release uncrossmatched RBC — {O‑negative vs O‑positive per policy; {number of units}; document indication}
- Order: Furosemide IV — {e.g., 20–40 mg IV now for TACO; hold if hypotension or hypovolemia}

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 66‑year‑old man with GI bleeding receives his first unit of RBCs. After 20 minutes he develops fever (38.9°C), chills, back pain, and dark urine. BP is 86/52 mmHg, HR 118/min. The nurse stops the transfusion and maintains IV access with normal saline. Which is the best next step?

### Options
A. Administer acetaminophen and restart transfusion once afebrile  
B. Give IV furosemide and resume transfusion at a slower rate  
C. Send a transfusion reaction workup (including DAT) and begin aggressive IV fluids  
D. Switch to O‑negative RBCs and continue the transfusion  
E. Administer IV methylprednisolone and immediately restart transfusion

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
Suspected acute hemolytic transfusion reaction requires immediate laboratory confirmation (including **DAT**) and aggressive resuscitation with isotonic fluids to maintain **UOP ≥1 mL/kg/h**, with pressors as needed, before any further transfusion is considered. Antipyretics, steroids, or diuretics are inappropriate without excluding hemolysis; the transfusion should not be resumed until evaluated per AABB hemovigilance guidance.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 28‑year‑old woman (unknown blood type) presents with exsanguinating pelvic trauma. She is obtunded, BP 72/38 mmHg, HR 132/min. There is no time for crossmatch. Which immediate blood product choice is most appropriate to initiate massive transfusion?

### Options
A. Emergency‑release O‑positive RBCs  
B. Emergency‑release O‑negative RBCs  
C. Type‑specific, uncrossmatched RBCs after an abbreviated screen  
D. Delay transfusion until full crossmatch is complete  
E. Group AB plasma only until RBC crossmatch returns

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
For females of childbearing potential with unknown type in life‑threatening hemorrhage, **O‑negative RBCs** are preferred to avoid RhD alloimmunization; this is a common pitfall when inventories are tight. Type‑specific or crossmatched units are ideal but unsafe to delay in hemorrhagic shock.

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions
- Q: TRALI vs TACO—what is the key management difference?  
  A: TRALI is noncardiogenic; provide supportive oxygen/ventilation; avoid routine diuretics. TACO is hydrostatic; give IV loop diuretics and slow future transfusions.
- Q: What fibrinogen target do you use during massive bleeding?  
  A: Maintain fibrinogen **≥1.5–2.0 g/L**; give cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate to achieve this.
- Q: What is the minimum urine output target during suspected acute hemolysis?  
  A: Aim **≥1 mL/kg/h** with isotonic fluids; add vasopressors if needed for MAP goals.
- Q: Standard plasma dose for coagulopathy correction?  
  A: **10–15 mL/kg** of plasma; recheck INR/PT and clinical bleeding after dosing.

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight
- Acute transfusion reaction: type (e.g., acute hemolytic, TRALI, TACO, allergic/anaphylaxis), acuity, suspected cause (e.g., ABO incompatibility vs volume overload), severity (shock/respiratory failure/DIC), objective evidence (vitals, DAT, hemolysis labs, imaging), and treatments given.
- Hemorrhagic shock due to {source}: acuity and stage, objective evidence (BP, lactate, Hgb trend, INR/fibrinogen/platelets), interventions (MTP activated, products/doses, calcium, warming, TXA if used), response.
- Anaphylaxis due to blood product: trigger, organ systems involved, objective evidence (hypotension, airway edema, hypoxemia), epinephrine dose and response, adjuncts, need for ICU/airway.
- TACO vs TRALI: document diagnostic rationale, timing (≤6 h), hemodynamics, BNP/echo/x‑ray findings, oxygen/ventilation needs, diuretic use (for TACO) or avoidance (for TRALI).
