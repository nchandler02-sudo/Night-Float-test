# Antibiotic Stewardship at Night

## Panic Card
- If septic shock, give first effective empiric antibiotic within **1 h** while initiating fluids and vasopressors to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; obtain cultures first only if this will not delay antibiotics. citeturn2search44turn2search47
- Verify true allergy history before broadening or desensitizing; if anaphylaxis risk is unclear, choose a non–cross-reactive agent and reassess urgently. 
- Dose right the first time: weight- and renal-adjusted loading doses (e.g., vancomycin AUC-based targeting **AUC/MIC 400–600**). citeturn2search26turn2search29
- Send source-appropriate cultures (two sets blood; targeted site) and begin source control planning; reassess at **48–72 h** for de‑escalation/stop. citeturn2search56
- Confirm Before Proceed: do not initiate long-acting/irreversible steps (e.g., desensitization) without verifying indication, allergy details, and necessity.

## Brief Overview
- Night stewardship priorities: distinguish time‑critical sepsis from non‑severe infection, start appropriate empiric therapy promptly in shock, and otherwise avoid unnecessary or overly broad antibiotics; reassess daily for de‑escalation. citeturn2search44
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Surviving Sepsis 2021 recommends antimicrobials within **1 h** for septic shock, with early cultures and daily de‑escalation; avoid routine double gram‑negative coverage unless high risk. citeturn2search44
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** IDSA/SHEA 2016 stewardship guideline endorses prospective audit/feedback, preauthorization, IV‑to‑PO conversion, and optimized dose/duration as core inpatient tactics. citeturn2search7turn2search11
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** CDC Core Elements (2019 update) frame night actions: clear accountability, indication + stop date on every order, and routine reporting/tracking of use and resistance. citeturn2search17turn2search14
- Obtain **blood cultures ×2** before antibiotics if feasible; send targeted site cultures (urine only if urinary symptoms or catheter change) to guide day‑2 narrowing. citeturn2search56turn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Avoid treating **asymptomatic bacteriuria** except pregnancy or invasive urologic procedures; delirium or falls alone are not UTI unless genitourinary/localizing signs or systemic instability. citeturn2search1turn2search6
- Use MRSA nasal PCR in pneumonia to **de‑escalate anti‑MRSA therapy** when negative (high NPV ≈95–97%), recognizing limited PPV; avoid use to “rule in.” citeturn2search52turn2search51
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** ATS/IDSA 2019 CAP supports 5‑day minimum therapy once clinically stable; abandon HCAP label; tailor diagnostics and de‑escalate based on risks and cultures. citeturn2search21
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** HAP/VAP 2016 recommends **~7‑day** total therapy with daily de‑escalation; obtain noninvasive respiratory samples and avoid routine prolonged courses. citeturn2search56
- For suspected ESBL/**AMR** infections, avoid piperacillin‑tazobactam for ESBL‑E bacteremia/pyelonephritis; prefer carbapenem or guideline‑preferred agents, then step down when susceptibilities allow. citeturn2search38turn2search42
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Vancomycin—target **AUC/MIC 400–600** to reduce nephrotoxicity vs trough‑only strategies; leverage pharmacy services for Bayesian/AUC dosing overnight. citeturn2search26turn2search29
- Document indication and **planned duration** for every antibiotic order (e.g., CAP 5 days if stable; cUTI 7–10 depending on source and agent). This supports automatic stop and next‑day review. citeturn2search21
- Consider **IV‑to‑PO** switch once hemodynamically stable, afebrile/improving, able to absorb PO, and with an available high‑bioavailability option (e.g., levofloxacin, linezolid); aligns with stewardship core elements and CAP practice. citeturn2search14turn2search21
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Test for **C. difficile** only with **≥3 unformed stools/24 h** and no laxatives in prior 48 h; treat with fidaxomicin preferred for initial/recurrent episodes per 2021 focused update. citeturn2search35turn2search32
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** De‑label false β‑lactam “allergies” when history is inconsistent; penicillin allergy evaluation improves access to first‑line therapy per stewardship best practices. citeturn2search7
- Overnight pitfalls: anchoring on a positive UA without symptoms (ASB), continuing vancomycin after negative MRSA nares, double covering gram‑negatives without an indication, and skipping stop dates—all escalate harm (AKI, CDI, resistance) without benefit. citeturn2search52turn2search56turn2search32

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Septic shock needing vasopressors to maintain **MAP ≥65 mmHg**, lactate **≥4 mmol/L**, or rapidly rising lactate despite fluids. citeturn2search44
- Escalating O₂/ventilatory support, concern for necrotizing/complicated infection (e.g., empyema), or hemodynamic instability after antibiotics. citeturn2search56
- AMR isolate (ESBL/CRE/DTR Pseudomonas/CRAB) or persistent bacteremia **>48–72 h** despite appropriate therapy—contact ID early. citeturn2search38

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 68‑year‑old man admitted with community‑acquired pneumonia received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. He is afebrile on day 2, oxygen needs down, and a **MRSA nares PCR is negative**. Sputum culture is non‑diagnostic. Vitals are stable; creatinine is rising slightly.

### Options
A. Continue all antibiotics for 7 days  
B. Stop azithromycin; continue ceftriaxone and vancomycin  
C. Stop vancomycin; continue ceftriaxone ± azithromycin to complete 5 days if stable  
D. Switch vancomycin to linezolid and continue dual therapy  
E. Stop all antibiotics today

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
Negative MRSA nasal PCR has a high negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia, supporting **de‑escalation off anti‑MRSA therapy** when clinical risk is low and the patient is improving; continuing ceftriaxone ± azithromycin to a **5‑day** total if stable aligns with ATS/IDSA CAP guidance. citeturn2search52turn2search21
De‑escalation reduces nephrotoxicity risk (vancomycin) without compromising outcomes. citeturn2search26

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
An 82‑year‑old woman with dementia is admitted for acute delirium without fever, dysuria, flank pain, or suprapubic tenderness. Indwelling catheter present; urinalysis shows pyuria and bacteriuria; urine culture later grows E. coli. Vitals stable; no leukocytosis.

### Options
A. Start ceftriaxone now for catheter‑associated UTI  
B. Start amoxicillin‑clavulanate and plan 7 days  
C. Replace the catheter, avoid antibiotics, evaluate noninfectious causes of delirium  
D. Give a single dose gentamicin and observe  
E. Begin piperacillin‑tazobactam for possible ESBL

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
This is **asymptomatic bacteriuria** with delirium alone; IDSA 2019 recommends **no antibiotics** (treat only in pregnancy or before invasive urologic urologic procedures). The pitfall is equating pyuria/culture positivity with infection; manage catheter and search for alternate delirium causes. citeturn2search1

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions
- Q: In septic shock, should empiric antibiotics begin within **1 hour** of recognition?  
  A: Yes. Early antimicrobials within 1 h are recommended by Surviving Sepsis 2021, alongside source control and de‑escalation. citeturn2search44
- Q: A **negative MRSA nares PCR** within 72 h of pneumonia presentation—can you stop empiric vancomycin if the patient is improving?  
  A: Yes; high NPV (~95–97%) supports de‑escalation when clinical risk is low. citeturn2search52turn2search51
- Q: Vancomycin PK target for serious MRSA infections?  
  A: **AUC/MIC 400–600** (MIC assumed 1 mg/L) to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity. citeturn2search26
- Q: Treat **asymptomatic bacteriuria** in older adults with delirium but no GU symptoms or instability?  
  A: No; do not treat ASB except pregnancy or invasive urologic procedures. citeturn2search1
- Q: Typical total duration for **HAP/VAP** when improving?  
  A: About **7 days** with daily reassessment for de‑escalation. citeturn2search56

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight
- Document infection diagnosis (acuity/type/source), suspected/confirmed pathogen, and sepsis severity (SOFA change, **MAP**, lactate) with objective data (vitals, labs, imaging). 
- Record cultures obtained **before** first dose when feasible, source control steps, and hemodynamic/oxygen status supporting severity. 
- Specify antibiotic indication, **dose/route/interval**, renal/hepatic adjustments, **planned duration/stop date**, and de‑escalation/IV‑to‑PO plan tied to culture and clinical milestones. 
- Clarify drug allergies (agent, reaction, timing) and risk stratification for β‑lactam use or need for alternative therapy. 
- Note high‑risk contexts (pregnancy, severe CKD/ESRD, cirrhosis, QT risk, active GI bleed) that affect selections, monitoring, and dosing.
