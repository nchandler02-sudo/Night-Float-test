# Hypertensive Emergency vs Urgency

## Panic Card
- Recheck BP with correct cuff/position; place continuous monitoring; if end-organ injury present, target **MAP reduction ≤20–25% in first hour**, then gradual control—avoid precipitous drops. Consider arterial line for titratable IV therapy. citeturn2search44turn2search6
- Rapidly screen BARKH end organs (brain, arteries/aorta, retina, kidney, heart) and obtain problem-directed imaging/labs; treat pain/anxiety that can elevate BP. citeturn2search6
- Start a titratable IV antihypertensive (e.g., nicardipine, clevidipine, labetalol) when emergency confirmed; set clear numeric BP goals based on the specific organ injury. citeturn2search6turn2search44
- Aortic dissection suspected: **IV beta-blocker first (e.g., esmolol), then vasodilator; goal SBP <120 mmHg and HR 60–80 within ~20 min**. citeturn2search13turn2search15
- Intracerebral hemorrhage: favor smooth control to **SBP 130–150 mmHg**; avoid lowering **<130 mmHg** acutely. citeturn2search7
- Acute ischemic stroke: before IV thrombolysis, **BP <185/110**; maintain **<180/105** for 24 h; if no reperfusion therapy, generally avoid lowering unless **≥220/120** (then reduce ~15% in 24 h). citeturn2search47turn2search46

## Brief Overview
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** The AHA 2024 acute care statement recommends abandoning “hypertensive urgency” terminology in favor of “asymptomatic markedly elevated BP” (≥180/110–120 without new/worsening target-organ damage); treat the patient, not the number. citeturn2search6turn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Hypertensive emergency is severe BP elevation with **acute target-organ injury** (BARKH: encephalopathy/stroke/ICH, aortic catastrophe, high-grade retinopathy, AKI/MAHA, ACS/acute pulmonary edema) and requires **IV** therapy with monitored titration. citeturn2search6
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Initial goal is **MAP ↓ ≤20–25% in the first hour**, then to **~160/100–110** over the next 2–6 h, unless a specific condition dictates otherwise (e.g., dissection, stroke). citeturn2search44
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Measurement matters—recheck with proper cuff/position, resolve reversible drivers (pain, anxiety, hypoxia, bladder distention, stimulants), and note that arterial lines are preferred when giving titratable IV agents. citeturn2search6turn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Asymptomatic markedly elevated BP generally should **not** be acutely lowered with IV agents; initiate/adjust oral therapy and arrange close follow‑up; avoid PRN IV hydralazine/labetalol “just for numbers.” citeturn2search6turn2search45
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Organ‑specific targets vary: aortic dissection **SBP <120** and HR 60–80 (beta‑blockade first), ICH **SBP 130–150**, AIS with thrombolysis **<185/110 pre‑bolus** and **<180/105 for 24 h**; AIS without reperfusion typically treat only if **≥220/120**. citeturn2search13turn2search7turn2search47turn2search46
- Differentiate pulmonary edema/ACS (favor IV nitroglycerin or clevidipine/nicardipine) versus sympathetic crises (avoid pure vasodilators until beta‑blockade if aortic dissection or pheo suspected). citeturn2search44
- In pregnancy/puerperium, **treat ≥160/110 confirmed within 15 min** using IV labetalol, IV hydralazine, or oral immediate‑release nifedipine; evaluate for preeclampsia/eclampsia and give magnesium when indicated. citeturn2search27turn2search29
- For AKI/CKD, avoid over‑rapid falls that worsen renal perfusion; choose easily titratable agents and track creatinine/urine output. citeturn2search44
- What must happen now: confirm emergency (symptoms/signs/labs/imaging), start titratable IV therapy with clear numeric targets, continuous monitoring, and early ICU involvement when instability, IV infusion, or neuro/ACS/aortic pathology is present. citeturn2search6
- What can wait until daytime: chronic regimen optimization, secondary HTN workup, ambulatory targets/risk calculators (per 2025 ACC/AHA outpatient guideline updates). citeturn2search4
- Pitfalls: mistaking pain/anxiety readings for emergencies; chasing “normal” BP quickly (risk of cerebral/coronary/renal hypoperfusion); giving thrombolysis without meeting BP thresholds; missing dissection in chest/back pain with pulse deficit. citeturn2search44turn2search47turn2search13
- ICU/consult calls to make early: neuro for ICH/AIS, cardiology for ACS/flash edema, cardiothoracic/vascular for dissection, nephrology for severe AKI; transfer if lacking continuous titration capacity. citeturn2search7turn2search13
- Documentation should distinguish “hypertensive emergency” from “asymptomatic markedly elevated BP”; avoid the ambiguous term “urgency” per AHA 2024. citeturn2search6
- **Confirm Before Proceed:** In AIS, do **not** rapidly normalize BP below recommended thresholds before/after reperfusion; in suspected dissection, **beta‑block first** before vasodilator; irreversible therapies (e.g., thrombolysis) require strict BP verification. citeturn2search47turn2search13
- Disposition pearls: most asymptomatic markedly elevated BP can be managed outpatient; true emergencies need monitored beds and IV drips; avoid unnecessary imaging in well patients without red flags. citeturn2search6turn2search42

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Requirement for titratable IV antihypertensive infusion and/or arterial line to meet time‑sensitive organ‑specific targets (e.g., ICH, AIS reperfusion, dissection). citeturn2search6
- Neurologic deficit or hemorrhage on imaging; SBP not achieving **130–150** in ICH within 1 h despite therapy. citeturn2search7
- Suspected or confirmed aortic dissection; need to reach **SBP <120** and HR 60–80 promptly with beta‑blockade. citeturn2search13
- Refractory pulmonary edema/ACS or ongoing end‑organ ischemia despite initial measures. citeturn2search44

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 62‑year‑old with sudden tearing chest pain radiating to the back has BP 208/118 mmHg and HR 112. Exam shows asymmetric arm BPs and a new diastolic murmur. ECG without STEMI. You suspect acute aortic dissection.

### Options
A. Start IV nicardipine infusion immediately to lower SBP below 120 mmHg  
B. Start IV esmolol, then add nicardipine to reach SBP <120 mmHg and HR 60–80  
C. Give sublingual nifedipine and observe  
D. Give IV hydralazine to rapidly lower SBP to normal  
E. Begin IV nitroprusside alone to rapidly lower MAP

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
For suspected dissection, guidelines recommend **beta‑blockade first** to blunt shear (HR 60–80), then add a vasodilator to achieve **SBP <120 mmHg** rapidly. Pure vasodilation before rate control can increase shear; hydralazine/nifedipine are inappropriate here. citeturn2search13turn2search15

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 74‑year‑old with acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS 6) arrives 7 hours after last‑known‑well, not eligible for thrombolysis or thrombectomy. BP is 210/112 mmHg; he is comfortable, oxygenating well, and has no chest pain, dyspnea, or AKI.

### Options
A. Start IV nicardipine to lower SBP to <140 mmHg in the first hour  
B. Give IV labetalol to reduce SBP by 30% immediately  
C. Allow permissive hypertension; no urgent BP lowering unless SBP ≥220 or DBP ≥120  
D. Start IV nitroprusside to normalize BP quickly  
E. Start oral captopril and amlodipine to reduce SBP to <130 mmHg tonight

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
In AIS patients **not** receiving reperfusion, guidelines generally avoid treatment unless **BP ≥220/120 mmHg**; if treated, reduce only about **15% in the first 24 h** to preserve perfusion. The pitfall is over‑rapid normalization worsening cerebral ischemia. citeturn2search47turn2search46

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight
- Hypertensive emergency vs asymptomatic markedly elevated BP; specify acute target‑organ injury present/absent and which organ(s) (brain/aorta/retina/kidney/heart) with objective evidence (exam/imaging/labs).  
- Acuity and severity with numeric goals: initial **MAP ↓ ≤20–25%**, organ‑specific targets (e.g., ICH SBP 130–150; AIS reperfusion thresholds; dissection SBP <120 & HR 60–80).  
- Etiology/precipitants (med nonadherence, stimulant use, pain, volume overload) and treatments used (IV nicardipine/clevidipine/labetalol, beta‑blocker first for dissection, magnesium for eclampsia) with responses.  
- Monitoring/intensity: continuous telemetry, arterial line if used, ICU vs step‑down, consults placed (neuro/cardiology/CT surgery/nephrology).
