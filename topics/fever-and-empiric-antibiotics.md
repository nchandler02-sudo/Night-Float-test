# Fever & Empiric Antibiotics

## Panic Card
- Assess ABCs; stabilize airway/breathing; target **SpO₂ 92–96%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia risk) and **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; give **30 mL/kg** balanced crystalloid rapidly if septic shock.
- Obtain **blood cultures ×2 sets** from different sites before antibiotics if this will not delay therapy; if shock, **start antibiotics within 1 hour**.
- Start guideline-concordant broad-spectrum therapy based on syndrome and risk (e.g., **cefepime or piperacillin–tazobactam ± vancomycin**; add **meropenem** if ESBL risk).
- Check **lactate** and repeat if initial elevated; place continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring; treat fever discomfort with **acetaminophen** unless contraindicated.
- Confirm Before Proceed: if meningitis suspected, give **empiric antibiotics immediately after blood cultures**; do not delay for CT/LP beyond **1 hour**.

## Brief Overview
- Fever on nights demands rapid triage for sepsis vs localized infection; differentiate unstable (shock, hypoxemia, altered mental status) from stable—start resuscitation and antibiotics early in shock while obtaining cultures.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Surviving Sepsis recommends **antibiotics within 1 hour** for septic shock and as soon as possible for sepsis after appropriate evaluation; each hour of delay increases mortality.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Draw **two sets of blood cultures** (aerobic/anaerobic) from separate sites before first dose when feasible; do not delay therapy in shock to finish cultures.
- Initial empiric choices hinge on source: urinary, pneumonia (CAP vs HAP/VAP), intra‑abdominal, skin/soft tissue, catheter‑related bloodstream infection, meningitis/encephalitis, or unknown source.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For HAP/VAP or prior IV antibiotics/structural lung disease, start **anti‑pseudomonal β‑lactam** (e.g., cefepime, piperacillin–tazobactam, or meropenem) ± **MRSA** coverage (vancomycin) depending on local MRSA prevalence and risk factors.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In CAP without severe disease or MRSA/Pseudomonas risks, **ceftriaxone + azithromycin** or **respiratory fluoroquinolone**; avoid routine anaerobic coverage for aspiration unless **abscess/empyema** suspected.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Febrile neutropenia (ANC **<0.5 ×10⁹/L** or expected to drop) requires **immediate anti‑pseudomonal β‑lactam** (cefepime, piperacillin–tazobactam, or meropenem) within **1 hour**; add vancomycin only for specific indications (MRSA risk, catheter infection, pneumonia, hemodynamic instability).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Suspected meningitis: give **vancomycin + ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime)**; add **ampicillin** if age ≥50/immunocompromised for Listeria; add **acyclovir** if encephalitis features; do not delay antibiotics for imaging/LP beyond **1 hour**.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Catheter‑related bloodstream infection: obtain **paired blood cultures (peripheral + line)**; consider **line removal** for S. aureus, Pseudomonas, Candida, or severe sepsis; start vancomycin plus gram‑negative coverage tailored to risk.
- For complicated intra‑abdominal infection, use **piperacillin–tazobactam** or **cefepime + metronidazole**; use **meropenem** if ESBL risk or severe sepsis; arrange source control (surgery/IR).
- In UTI/pyelonephritis with sepsis, give **ceftriaxone** or **cefepime**; escalate to **piperacillin–tazobactam** or **meropenem** for obstruction, recent healthcare exposure, or ESBL risk; obtain renal ultrasound if obstruction suspected.
- Document allergies carefully; in low‑risk penicillin “allergy” (non‑IgE, remote rash), β‑lactams are usually safe; consider test dose if needed—this improves outcomes and stewardship.
- Adjust doses for renal/hepatic dysfunction; monitor vancomycin AUC/levels; avoid stacking nephrotoxins (loop diuretics, ACEi/ARBs, IV contrast) when possible.
- De‑escalate within **48–72 h** based on cultures and clinical response; target **5–7 days** for many uncomplicated bacterial syndromes (e.g., HAP without complications), longer when deep-seated or source not controlled.
- Pitfalls: missing hypoperfusion (normal BP but **lactate ≥4 mmol/L**), under‑dosing in obesity, unnecessary anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonitis, and forgetting antifungal/atypical coverage in high‑risk hosts.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Hemodynamic targets: **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; if persistent hypotension after fluids, start **norepinephrine** first‑line; add **vasopressin** if needed; reassess volume responsiveness with dynamic measures.
- Confirm Before Proceed: before removing a suspected infected central line, ensure paired cultures and assess for instability/tunnel infection; removal is irreversible and impacts diagnostic yield/source control documentation.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent **MAP <65 mmHg** or rising **lactate ≥4 mmol/L** despite fluids and early antibiotics.
- Escalating oxygen needs to **HFNC/NRB** or new **acute hypoxemic respiratory failure**.
- New **altered mental status**, focal neurologic deficits, or concern for **meningitis/encephalitis**.
- Rapidly progressive soft tissue infection, suspected **necrotizing fasciitis**, or **compartment syndrome**.

## Orders to Place Now
- Order: Sepsis bundle labs — {CBC, CMP, magnesium, phosphorus, lactate now and 2–4 h, PT/INR, aPTT}
- Order: Blood cultures ×2 — {two peripheral sites before first antibiotic dose if feasible}
- Order: Empiric antibiotics — {syndrome={HAP/VAP, CAP, UTI/pyelo, IAI, unknown}, agents={cefepime or piperacillin–tazobactam ± vancomycin; meropenem if ESBL risk}, time=now, renal_dose=adjust}
- Order: Imaging — {CXR portable now; add CT {abdomen/pelvis} with contrast if IAI suspected; CT head before LP only if focal deficits, immunocompromise, or papilledema}
- Order: Fluid resuscitation — {balanced crystalloid 30 mL/kg bolus; reassess hemodynamics; start norepinephrine if MAP <65 mmHg after fluids}

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 72‑year‑old man with diabetes presents from the ward with fever 39.2°C, HR 118, BP 88/54 mmHg, RR 26, SpO₂ 93% on 2 L. He is confused. Exam shows suprapubic tenderness and a chronic Foley. Labs: WBC 17 ×10⁹/L, creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (baseline 1.0), lactate 4.2 mmol/L. Chest x‑ray is clear. Two nurses are at bedside to draw cultures.

### Options
A. Await blood culture completion before giving antibiotics  
B. Give 30 mL/kg crystalloid, start norepinephrine if needed, and administer cefepime plus vancomycin now  
C. Start acetaminophen and repeat vitals in 2 hours  
D. Order CT abdomen/pelvis first to evaluate for obstruction  
E. Start ceftriaxone and delay pressors until after 3 L fluids regardless of MAP

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Early broad‑spectrum antibiotics within **1 hour** of septic shock and **30 mL/kg** fluids with pressors to **MAP ≥65 mmHg** improve survival per Surviving Sepsis. Obtain cultures first if it does not delay therapy, but do not wait in shock. Cefepime plus vancomycin covers gram‑negatives including Pseudomonas and MRSA risk from chronic devices; imaging can follow stabilization.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 63‑year‑old woman with prior stroke aspirates during dinner and develops fever 38.6°C and cough 6 hours later. She is stable: BP 132/78, HR 96, SpO₂ 95% on room air. CXR shows right lower lobe infiltrate without cavitation or effusion. No severe periodontal disease. No prior MRSA/Pseudomonas risks.

### Options
A. Start ampicillin–sulbactam for “aspiration” to cover anaerobes routinely  
B. Start ceftriaxone plus azithromycin and withhold anaerobic coverage  
C. Start piperacillin–tazobactam plus vancomycin for broad coverage  
D. Start levofloxacin plus metronidazole for anaerobes  
E. Withhold all antibiotics because aspiration pneumonitis never needs antibiotics

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Guidelines advise **no routine anaerobic coverage** for suspected aspiration pneumonia unless **abscess/empyema** or poor dentition/necrosis; standard CAP therapy is appropriate. The pitfall is reflexively adding anaerobic therapy without indications, increasing adverse effects and resistance.

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions
- Q: What is the antibiotic timing goal in septic shock?  
  A: Administer broad‑spectrum antibiotics within **1 hour** of recognition after obtaining cultures if this does not delay therapy.
- Q: Define febrile neutropenia by ANC.  
  A: **ANC <0.5 ×10⁹/L** or expected to fall below that within 48 hours warrants immediate anti‑pseudomonal β‑lactam.
- Q: When do you add anaerobic coverage in aspiration?  
  A: Only if **lung abscess, empyema, or severe periodontal disease/necrotizing infection** is suspected.
- Q: What MAP target guides vasopressor titration?  
  A: **MAP ≥65 mmHg** with norepinephrine first‑line; add vasopressin if needed.

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight
- Sepsis due to suspected catheter‑associated UTI, with acute kidney injury: include acuity, source, organism if known, **objective evidence** (T 39.2°C, **lactate 4.2 mmol/L**, hypotension, WBC 17), and treatments (30 mL/kg fluids, norepinephrine, cefepime + vancomycin).
- Hospital‑acquired pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonia: specify type, risk factors (recent hospitalization/ventilation), radiographic findings, oxygen requirement, and chosen empiric regimen with rationale (no anaerobes unless abscess/empyema).
- Febrile neutropenia due to chemotherapy: include **ANC value**, hemodynamic status, suspected source, and immediate anti‑pseudomonal therapy timing; note MRSA indications if adding vancomycin.
- Catheter‑related bloodstream infection suspected: document paired cultures, line status (kept vs removed with indication), organism if available, and hemodynamic impact; capture source control steps and ID consult if obtained.
