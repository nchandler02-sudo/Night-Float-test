# VTE/PE Practicalities

## Panic Card
- Assess airway/breathing/circulation; titrate oxygen to **SpO₂ ≥92%**; if shock, start norepinephrine to target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** and obtain large‑bore IV access.
- Start parenteral anticoagulation unless absolute contraindication; prefer unfractionated heparin (UFH) if any chance of procedures/lysis (short half‑life, reversible).
- If PE with hypotension or cardiac arrest, activate PE/PERT pathway and get stat bedside echo for RV failure; prepare for systemic thrombolysis or catheter/surgical reperfusion.
- “Confirm Before Proceed”: screen absolute contraindications before systemic thrombolysis (intracranial pathology, recent major surgery/bleed, uncontrolled hypertension).
- If deteriorating despite support, escalate rapidly: consider systemic thrombolysis (alteplase **100 mg IV over 2 h**) or catheter‑directed/surgical embolectomy; involve ICU and cardiology/IR/CT surgery early.

## Brief Overview
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Risk‑stratify early: high‑risk (massive) = **sustained SBP <90 mmHg** or need for vasopressors; intermediate‑risk = normotension with RV dysfunction and/or positive troponin/BNP; low‑risk = none of the above (ESC/ERS; AHA/ACC; CHEST; ASH).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use sPESI/PESI to guide level of care and early discharge; **sPESI 0** suggests low short‑term mortality if reliable follow‑up and no concerning comorbidity.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** RV dysfunction can be defined by echo or CTPA (**RV:LV ≥1.0**) plus biomarker elevation; intermediate‑high risk requires monitored setting and early team discussion.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Initiate anticoagulation promptly once PE is likely and bleeding risk acceptable; parenteral therapy is preferred if unstable or if reperfusion might be needed; choose UFH when procedural/lysis pathways are on the table.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** UFH dosing: **80 units/kg IV bolus** then **18 units/kg/h** infusion with aPTT or anti‑Xa titration; consider reduced/omit bolus in tenuous patients pending lysis/catheter therapy.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** LMWH (enoxaparin) **1 mg/kg SC q12h** (or **1 mg/kg daily** if **CrCl <30 mL/min**) is preferred over UFH in stable patients without procedures expected; lower HIT risk and more predictable.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Direct oral anticoagulants are first‑line for most hemodynamically stable patients: apixaban **10 mg BID ×7 d → 5 mg BID**; rivaroxaban **15 mg BID ×21 d → 20 mg daily**; avoid in **CrCl <30 mL/min**, significant liver disease, pregnancy, or triple‑positive antiphospholipid syndrome.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** High‑risk PE (shock/hypotension) warrants immediate reperfusion; systemic thrombolysis (alteplase **100 mg over 2 h**) is standard when no absolute contraindication exists; catheter‑directed therapy or surgical embolectomy are alternatives when bleeding risk is high or lysis fails.
- Distinguish what must happen now (stabilize ABCs, start anticoagulation, risk‑stratify, call PERT/ICU if intermediate‑high/high risk) versus what can wait (thrombophilia testing, long‑term anticoagulation duration discussion, outpatient exercise counseling).
- Pitfalls: missing occult RV strain in “normal BP” patients (watch for rising troponin/BNP, **lactate >2 mmol/L**, tachycardia, escalating O₂); delaying anticoagulation for hours while waiting for imaging in a high‑probability case without bleeding risk.
- Consider IVC filter only if **absolute contraindication to anticoagulation** or recurrent PE despite **therapeutic** anticoagulation; plan removal once anticoagulation can resume.
- Treat cancer‑associated VTE with a DOAC or LMWH; choose LMWH or apixaban preferentially when GI/GU bleeding risk is high; coordinate with oncology for procedures and drug‑drug interactions.
- Pregnancy/postpartum: favor LMWH throughout; avoid DOACs and warfarin in pregnancy; consult MFM; adapt imaging to minimize radiation while ensuring diagnosis.
- Subsegmental PE without DVT and low recurrence risk may be observed with close follow‑up; if high risk (active cancer, reduced cardiopulmonary reserve, pregnancy), anticoagulate.
- “Confirm Before Proceed”: irreversible steps include systemic thrombolysis and urgent anticoagulation reversal; re‑check last head imaging, recent surgeries, and platelet count before proceeding.
- Disposition: low‑risk, reliable patients may be managed early‑discharge/outpatient on DOACs; intermediate‑high risk needs monitored unit; high‑risk goes to ICU with vasopressor/hemodynamic support.
- Follow‑up: arrange 3‑month reassessment to decide on indefinite therapy for unprovoked VTE; screen persistent dyspnea for CTEPH; ensure anticoagulant adherence and bleeding surveillance.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Hypotension (**SBP <90 mmHg** for ≥15 min) or vasopressor requirement, or **MAP <65 mmHg** despite fluids.
- Evidence of RV failure with biomarker elevation (troponin/BNP), **RV:LV ≥1.0**, or severe hypoxemia requiring high‑flow/NIV or escalating FiO₂.
- Rising **lactate >2 mmol/L**, syncope, or recurrent/progressive PE on therapy.
- Contraindication to anticoagulation with ongoing PE, or consideration of thrombolysis/catheter/surgical embolectomy.
- Cardiac arrest or peri‑arrest physiology; activate PERT and consider lysis/embolectomy/ECMO.

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 67‑year‑old man with sudden dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain is hypotensive (BP 78/48 mmHg), tachycardic, and hypoxemic on 6 L nasal cannula. CTPA shows extensive bilateral PE with **RV:LV 1.2**. Troponin is elevated. He has no history of recent surgery or intracranial disease. UFH was started 20 minutes ago.

### Options
A. Continue UFH alone and observe in ICU  
B. Systemic thrombolysis with alteplase **100 mg IV over 2 h**  
C. Place an IVC filter and continue UFH  
D. Catheter‑directed thrombolysis as first‑line in all high‑risk PE  
E. Start a DOAC now and stop UFH

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
High‑risk (massive) PE with hypotension and RV dysfunction warrants immediate reperfusion; systemic thrombolysis with alteplase **100 mg over 2 h** is recommended when no absolute contraindication exists. UFH alone is inadequate in shock; IVC filters are not first‑line when anticoagulation is feasible; DOACs are not used in unstable patients; catheter‑directed therapy is reserved for bleeding risk or failed lysis.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 58‑year‑old woman with acute PE, **SBP 82/50 mmHg**, RV dilation on echo, and rising lactate presents 10 days after a large ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation. UFH is infusing.

### Options
A. Systemic thrombolysis with alteplase **100 mg over 2 h**  
B. Escalate UFH only and avoid reperfusion therapies  
C. Emergent catheter‑directed embolectomy/thrombolysis after multidisciplinary discussion  
D. Insert IVC filter and stop anticoagulation  
E. Switch to rivaroxaban urgently

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
Recent intracranial hemorrhage is an absolute contraindication to systemic thrombolysis; in high‑risk PE with shock, catheter‑based or surgical embolectomy is preferred while continuing UFH. The pitfall is proceeding with systemic lysis despite a clear absolute contraindication; IVC filter alone is insufficient in shock without reperfusion.

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions
- Q: What RV/LV ratio on CTPA signals RV strain that upstages risk?  
  A: **RV:LV ≥1.0** suggests RV dysfunction and supports intermediate‑risk categorization.
- Q: What is the weight‑based UFH starting regimen for PE?  
  A: **80 U/kg IV bolus** then **18 U/kg/h** infusion with aPTT/anti‑Xa titration.
- Q: First‑line outpatient regimen for stable PE without severe kidney/liver disease?  
  A: Apixaban **10 mg BID ×7 d → 5 mg BID** or rivaroxaban **15 mg BID ×21 d → 20 mg daily**.
- Q: When is an IVC filter appropriate?  
  A: Only for **absolute contraindication to anticoagulation** or recurrent PE despite verified therapeutic anticoagulation.

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight
- Acute pulmonary embolism with risk category (high‑risk with shock / intermediate‑high with RV strain / low‑risk) + objective data (CTPA **RV:LV**, troponin/BNP, lactate, echo findings).
- Etiology/association: provoked vs unprovoked; transient risk (recent surgery, immobilization) vs persistent (active cancer, APS).
- Right heart failure/cor pulmonale status and presence/absence of hypoxemic respiratory failure; hemodynamic instability (**MAP**, vasopressors).
- Treatment and intensity: therapeutic anticoagulation (agent, **dose**, monitoring), thrombolysis or catheter/surgical embolectomy (timing, response), IVC filter if placed with indication.
- Bleeding risk/contraindications explicitly stated (recent ICH/surgery, platelet count), and plan for duration of anticoagulation and follow‑up.
