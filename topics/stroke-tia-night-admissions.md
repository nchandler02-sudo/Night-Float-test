# Stroke/TIA (Night Admissions)

## Panic Card
- ABCs, vitals, neuro checks; keep **SpO₂ ≥94%**; treat hypoglycemia **glucose <3.3 mmol/L** immediately; maintain **glucose 7.8–10.0 mmol/L**.
- Head imaging confirmed? If ischemic and within window, prepare thrombolysis: reduce BP to **<185/110 mmHg** before IV thrombolysis, then maintain **≤180/105 mmHg** for 24 h.
- Not a thrombolysis candidate: permissive hypertension up to **220/120 mmHg** in the first 24–48 h unless target-organ risk or other indication to treat.
- If large-vessel occlusion suspected, obtain CTA head/neck and call for transfer/EVT; EVT window now **up to 24 h** in selected patients.
- NPO until swallow screen; raise HOB 30°; avoid antithrombotics until brain hemorrhage is excluded; start DVT prophylaxis as appropriate.
- Confirm Before Proceed: verify **last-known-well** time, prior **anticoagulant use**, and absolute contraindications prior to thrombolysis or emergent anticoagulation reversal.

## Brief Overview
- Night priorities: confirm stroke type, onset (last known well), eligibility for reperfusion, and immediate risks (airway compromise, hemorrhage, malignant BP). Keep **SpO₂ ≥94%** and treat fever **>37.5°C**; avoid routine oxygen if not hypoxemic.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** IV thrombolysis is recommended up to **4.5 h** from onset for disabling deficits when eligible; use **alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg; 10% bolus then 60 min)** or **tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus (max 25 mg)** as an evidence‑supported alternative. 
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For thrombolysis candidates, lower BP to **<185/110 mmHg** using IV labetalol (10–20 mg boluses), nicardipine (start 5 mg/h, titrate by 2.5 mg/h q5–15 min), or clevidipine (1–2 mg/h, double q90 s to effect). Maintain **≤180/105 mmHg** for 24 h post‑bolus.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** If not receiving thrombolysis/EVT, permit BP up to **220/120 mmHg** during the first day; if higher or comorbid risk (aortic dissection, ACS, pulmonary edema), lower by **~15% in 24 h**, avoiding rapid drops that endanger penumbra.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Mechanical thrombectomy for anterior circulation large‑vessel occlusion is beneficial up to **6–24 h** in selected patients (DAWN/DEFUSE‑3 style imaging selection); expedite CTA/MRA and neurology/interventional consult.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For “wake‑up” or unknown‑onset stroke, consider reperfusion selection by DWI–FLAIR mismatch or perfusion mismatch per local protocol; thrombolysis is for disabling deficits with appropriate imaging selection when applicable.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Antiplatelets: if no thrombolysis and hemorrhage excluded, give aspirin promptly; for **minor stroke (NIHSS ≤3) or high‑risk TIA (ABCD₂ ≥4)**, initiate **dual antiplatelet therapy** (aspirin + clopidogrel) **within 24 h** for **21 days**, then continue single agent.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Anticoagulation: for atrial fibrillation–related ischemic stroke, start DOAC/warfarin after imaging review and timing by severity (e.g., “1–3–6–12‑day” approach); for **TIA** without infarct, anticoagulation can often begin **same day** if no bleeding risk.
- Distinguish TIA vs stroke: TIA = transient focal deficit without infarct on imaging; still high early risk. All TIA/night admissions need vascular imaging (CTA/MRA or carotid US), ECG, telemetry, and risk factor initiation (statin, BP, DM).
- Pitfalls: giving thrombolysis despite **recent DOAC (<48 h)** or **INR >1.7**; missing **large posterior circulation** occlusions with subtle symptoms; initiating antithrombotic therapy before post‑thrombolysis 24 h imaging; neglecting **swallow screen** → aspiration.
- What must happen now vs later: now—ABCs, glucose correction, emergent brain and vascular imaging, eligibility for thrombolysis/EVT, BP management, NPO and swallow screen, antithrombotic plan. Later—complete etiologic workup, rehab/OT/PT, lifestyle and secondary prevention optimization.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Glycemic control: treat hypoglycemia **<3.3 mmol/L**; target **7.8–10.0 mmol/L** (140–180 mg/dL) using insulin protocols; avoid intensive control that risks hypoglycemia.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Oxygen: no routine O₂ in nonhypoxemic patients; start O₂ if **SpO₂ <94%** and titrate to avoid hyperoxia; manage underlying causes (aspiration, edema).
- DVT prophylaxis: use intermittent pneumatic compression for all; pharmacologic prophylaxis unless contraindicated; after thrombolysis, wait **≥24 h and repeat head imaging** before starting.
- Secondary prevention tonight: start **high‑intensity statin** (e.g., atorvastatin), manage BP (long‑term goal often **<130/80 mmHg**), and counsel on smoking cessation and sleep apnea evaluation.
- Communication: document precise **onset**, **NIHSS**, imaging timestamps, and eligibility decisions. Use “Confirm Before Proceed” for irreversible steps (thrombolysis, anticoag reversal, MTP).
- Disposition: consider neuro ICU/step‑down if moderate/severe deficits, BP/airway needs, post‑lytics monitoring, or EVT transfer. Early therapy consults reduce complications.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Depressed airway protection, **SpO₂ <90%** despite supplemental O₂, or need for ventilatory support.
- Rapidly worsening neuro exam, **NIHSS increase ≥4**, new decreased consciousness, or suspected malignant edema.
- Escalating vasoactive needs to maintain **BP targets** or refractory hypertension requiring continuous infusion.
- Post‑thrombolysis deterioration or acute headache/vomiting with **new ICH on CT**.
- Hemodynamic/arrhythmic instability (e.g., new AF with RVR and hypotension) or **recurrent TIAs/crescendo events**.

## Orders to Place Now
- Order: Neuro checks and vitals — {q1h for 6 h, then q2h for 16 h, then q4h; hold parameters for SBP/DBP/HR}
- Order: NPO and swallow screen — {bedside swallow before any PO; SLP eval if failed}
- Order: Non‑contrast head CT ± CTA head/neck — {stat; include last‑known‑well; rule‑out ICH; assess LVO}
- Order: Thrombolysis vs EVT pathway — {if eligible: agent {alteplase/tenecteplase}, weight {kg}, dose {mg}, BP targets; if EVT, activate transfer}
- Order: Antithrombotic plan — {aspirin load vs DAPT initiation vs defer 24 h post‑thrombolysis; list contraindications}
- Order: Glucose and BP management — {insulin protocol to 7.8–10 mmol/L; IV labetalol/nicardipine/clevidipine per BP goals}

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 68‑year‑old with sudden right hemiparesis and aphasia presents 90 minutes after last‑known‑well. BP is 196/112 mmHg, glucose 5.2 mmol/L, NIHSS 10, non‑contrast CT shows no hemorrhage. No anticoagulant use. CTA shows no proximal LVO. What is the best next step?

### Options
A. Give aspirin 325 mg now and observe overnight  
B. Lower BP to <185/110 mmHg with IV labetalol, then administer IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg  
C. Start IV heparin infusion and schedule MRI in the morning  
D. Defer thrombolysis pending MRI DWI–FLAIR mismatch  
E. Arrange transfer for EVT only without thrombolysis

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Eligible patients with disabling deficits within **≤4.5 h** should receive IV thrombolysis after BP is reduced to **<185/110 mmHg**, then maintained **≤180/105 mmHg** for 24 h. Aspirin and heparin are inferior initial strategies in this window; EVT is reserved for LVO or select cases. Evidence supports alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) or tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg when appropriate.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 74‑year‑old awakens with left arm weakness and dysarthria; last‑known‑well is 8 hours prior. CT shows no hemorrhage; MRI shows DWI–FLAIR mismatch consistent with acute ischemia. He took apixaban 5 mg 6 hours before bed for AF. BP 168/98 mmHg, NIHSS 5. CTA shows right M2 occlusion.

### Options
A. Administer IV alteplase now based on MRI mismatch  
B. Administer IV tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg now  
C. Avoid thrombolysis; consult for EVT and proceed if eligible  
D. Start IV unfractionated heparin infusion  
E. Give aspirin and clopidogrel now and reassess in the morning

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
Recent DOAC ingestion (within ~48 h without reliable drug level) is a contraindication to IV thrombolysis. In selected patients beyond **6 h** with demonstrable LVO and favorable imaging, EVT offers benefit. The pitfall is administering thrombolysis despite **recent DOAC use**.

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions

  A: **<185/110 mmHg** before bolus; **≤180/105 mmHg** for 24 h after.
- Q: Target inpatient glucose range for acute stroke?  
  A: **7.8–10.0 mmol/L** (140–180 mg/dL); avoid intensive control that risks hypoglycemia.
- Q: When initiate DAPT in minor ischemic stroke/high‑risk TIA?  
  A: Within **24 h** of symptom onset (after hemorrhage excluded) for **21 days**, then single agent.
