# Anaphylaxis

## Panic Card
- Give epinephrine IM to mid‑anterolateral thigh now: **0.3–0.5 mg (1 mg/mL)**; repeat every **5–15 min** as needed. Keep patient **supine with legs elevated**; apply **high‑flow O₂**. Call for help and bring airway cart. citeturn2search13turn2search24
- Establish 2 large‑bore IVs; rapid isotonic crystalloids **1–2 L**; target **MAP ≥65 mmHg**. citeturn2search7
- If airway compromise (stridor/voice change/lingual or laryngeal edema), call anesthesia/ENT early and prepare for **difficult airway**; avoid sitting upright if hypotensive. citeturn2search24
- Refractory hypotension despite IM epinephrine and fluids: start **epinephrine infusion** (titrate to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**) and consider **glucagon 1–5 mg IV over 5 min, then 5–15 µg/min** if on β‑blocker. citeturn2search24turn2search32
- Confirm Before Proceed: use **pump‑driven epinephrine infusion with correct concentration**; avoid IV epinephrine bolus outside cardiac arrest/experienced hands to prevent dosing error. citeturn2search24

## Brief Overview
- Anaphylaxis is a rapidly evolving, multi‑system emergency; **IM epinephrine is first‑line and time‑critical**, and treatment should not wait for diagnostic certainty. Night‑float priorities are airway, breathing, circulation, and immediate IM dosing with repeat assessment every 5–15 minutes. citeturn2search13
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Adult IM dose **0.3–0.5 mg (1 mg/mL)** to the lateral thigh, repeat every **5–15 min** until improved; do not substitute antihistamines or steroids for epinephrine. citeturn2search13turn2search18
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Positioning matters—keep the patient **supine with legs elevated** (or left lateral in late pregnancy) to reduce sudden circulatory collapse; provide high‑flow oxygen and continuous monitoring. citeturn2search24
- **What must happen now:** Remove/stop the trigger (e.g., antibiotic/IV contrast), give IM epinephrine, start O₂, secure IV access, give **1–2 L** isotonic fluids rapidly if hypotensive, and call for senior help/anesthesia early for voice change/stridor. **What can wait:** adjunct H1/H2 blockers, corticosteroids, root‑cause workup. citeturn2search7turn2search24
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For **refractory shock**, start **epinephrine infusion** (use pump; avoid IV bolus) and titrate to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; large fluid volumes may be required due to profound vasodilation and capillary leak. citeturn2search24turn2search7
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** If on **β‑blockers** and not responding, give **glucagon 1–5 mg IV over 5 min**, then **5–15 µg/min** infusion (watch for nausea/vomiting). citeturn2search32
- Bronchospasm: add **nebulized β‑agonist (albuterol)**; consider nebulized epinephrine for laryngeal edema while preparing a definitive airway—these are **adjuncts**, not substitutes for IM epinephrine. citeturn2search24
- **Confirm Before Proceed:** Double‑check **epinephrine concentration and route** (1 mg/mL IM vs 0.1 mg/mL IV infusion) to prevent **10–100×** dosing errors. citeturn2search24
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Draw **serum tryptase** as soon as feasible **within 1–3 h of symptom onset**, and a **baseline at 24–48 h**; apply the **20% + 2 ng/L rule** to support mast‑cell activation and consider mast‑cell disorders when baseline is elevated. citeturn2search2turn2search4
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Observation: low‑risk patients who respond promptly may be observed **≥2–6 h**; higher‑risk (severe presentation, multiple epinephrine doses, hypotension, airway involvement) often require **≥6–12 h** or admission due to **biphasic risk**. citeturn2search24
- Common inpatient triggers: antibiotics, perioperative agents (neuromuscular blockers, chlorhexidine, latex), radiocontrast, blood products, biologics; document precisely and refer for allergy evaluation after stabilization. citeturn2search7
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Do **not** delay epinephrine while applying formal diagnostic criteria; meeting criteria is **not required** before giving epinephrine. citeturn2search16
- Antihistamines (H1±H2) can reduce cutaneous symptoms; **corticosteroids do not treat acute life‑threatening features** and should never replace epinephrine; they may be used as adjuncts per clinician judgment. citeturn2search18
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Early **anesthesia/ICU** involvement for progressive airway edema, stridor, fatigue, or refractory hypotension; prepare for a **difficult airway** and **early intubation** if voice changes/stridor evolve. citeturn2search24
- **Pitfalls:** Attributing hypotension/wheeze to other causes (e.g., sepsis, COPD) and **withholding epinephrine**; giving IV bolus epinephrine; sitting the hypotensive patient upright; missing biphasic deterioration after early discharge. citeturn2search24
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** After stabilization, ensure **discharge planning** (if appropriate) includes education, trigger avoidance plan, and epinephrine auto‑injector prescribing/training with documented allergy follow‑up. citeturn2search18

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Need for **epinephrine infusion** or persistent hypotension despite ≥2 IM doses and adequate fluids. citeturn2search24
- Stridor, voice change, tongue/laryngeal edema, or anticipated **difficult airway**. citeturn2search24
- Recurrent/worsening symptoms during observation (suspected **biphasic** reaction) or need for prolonged monitoring due to comorbidities (CAD, severe asthma, pregnancy). citeturn2search24
- Suspected peri‑operative anaphylaxis or high‑risk triggers (e.g., neuromuscular blockers, chlorhexidine) requiring specialty evaluation. citeturn2search7

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 58‑year‑old inpatient develops generalized urticaria, hoarseness, wheeze, and systolic BP 82 mmHg five minutes after starting IV cefazolin. He is tachycardic and anxious. IV access is in place.

### Options
A. Administer intramuscular epinephrine 0.5 mg now to the lateral thigh and place the patient supine
B. Give IV diphenhydramine 50 mg and observe for response
C. Start methylprednisolone 125 mg IV and obtain a stat tryptase level before any other therapy
D. Begin norepinephrine infusion and avoid epinephrine due to CAD risk
E. Intubate now without medications and reassess before giving epinephrine

### Correct answer
A

### Rationale
**IM epinephrine is first‑line and should be given immediately** for suspected anaphylaxis with airway and circulatory involvement; positioning and oxygen are concurrent priorities. Antihistamines and corticosteroids are adjuncts only and **must not delay epinephrine**. IV pressors may be needed later if refractory after IM epinephrine and fluids. citeturn2search13turn2search24

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 72‑year‑old with atrial fibrillation on metoprolol develops hypotension (SBP 72 mmHg), diffuse hives, and wheeze after vancomycin. He received two appropriate IM epinephrine doses and 1.5 L isotonic fluid with minimal improvement. He is alert, with persistent bronchospasm.

### Options
A. Administer an IV epinephrine bolus
B. Start an epinephrine infusion and add glucagon 1–5 mg IV over 5 min, then 5–15 µg/min
C. Give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV and observe
D. Start diphenhydramine 50 mg IV and albuterol; avoid further adrenergics due to β‑blocker
E. Begin vasopressin infusion and avoid epinephrine due to β‑blocker

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Refractory anaphylaxis in patients on **β‑blockers** may improve with **glucagon** (bypasses β‑receptors) along with **epinephrine infusion** titrated to MAP goals. Avoid IV epinephrine **bolus** due to dosing error/arrhythmia risk—the pitfall is undertreating epinephrine‑refractory shock without adding glucagon when β‑blockade is present. citeturn2search24turn2search32
