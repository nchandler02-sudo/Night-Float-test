# Altered Mental Status

## Panic Card
- Assess ABCs; secure airway if **GCS ≤8** or loss of protective reflexes; target **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; titrate O₂ to **SpO₂ 94–98%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnic risk).  
- Check capillary glucose immediately; if **<3.0 mmol/L**, give **dextrose 25 g IV** and recheck; give **thiamine 100 mg IV** in malnutrition/alcohol use (do not delay glucose for thiamine).  
- Suspected opioid toxicity: give **naloxone 0.04–0.4 mg IV**, titrate q2–3 min up to 2 mg; consider infusion if recurrent.  
- Active seizure/status: **lorazepam 2 mg IV q1–2 min** up to 4–8 mg, then **levetiracetam 60 mg/kg (max 4500 mg)** or **fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg**; prepare for airway protection.  
- Suspected sepsis: obtain cultures, give broad‑spectrum antibiotics within 1 h, start fluids and **norepinephrine** to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; lactate and repeat assessment.

## Brief Overview
- Altered mental status (AMS) spans agitation, delirium, somnolence, and coma; prioritize reversible causes (hypoxia, hypoglycemia, opioids/sedatives, seizures, stroke, sepsis, electrolyte/acid‑base disorders, hepatic/uremic encephalopathy, Wernicke encephalopathy, CNS infection, trauma).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For suspected stroke with focal deficit/acute onset, obtain non‑contrast head CT rapidly; **IV thrombolysis ≤4.5 h** from last‑known‑well in eligible patients; evaluate for mechanical thrombectomy up to **24 h** in selected LVO patients.  
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Sepsis with AMS is organ dysfunction; initiate **antibiotics within 1 h**, **30 mL/kg** balanced crystalloids for hypotension or lactate ≥4, and **norepinephrine** as first‑line vasopressor to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; reassess volume and perfusion frequently.  
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Status epilepticus requires benzodiazepines first (IM midazolam or IV lorazepam), then a second‑line antiseizure medication (fosphenytoin, valproate, or levetiracetam) if seizures persist; avoid treatment delays.  
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** ICU delirium management emphasizes non‑pharmacologic measures (reorientation, sleep, mobilization), pain control, and light sedation; avoid benzodiazepines unless specifically indicated (e.g., alcohol withdrawal).  
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Alcohol withdrawal delirium presents with tremor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, agitation, hallucinations; treat with symptom‑triggered or front‑loaded benzodiazepines; add adjuncts (e.g., phenobarbital) per protocol if refractory; correct electrolytes and give **thiamine**.  
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In hyper‑ or hyponatremia causing AMS, limit **Na⁺ correction to ≤8–10 mmol/L per 24 h** (≤4–6 if high risk) to prevent osmotic demyelination or cerebral edema; for severe symptomatic hyponatremia (e.g., seizures), give **3% saline 100 mL IV bolus** and recheck sodium.
- What must happen now vs later: now—stabilize airway/breathing/circulation, glucose check/tx, antidotes (naloxone), seizure control, treat sepsis, obtain head CT if focal deficits/trauma/anticoagulation. Later—broad diagnostic panels, medication reconciliation, neurocognitive assessment, delirium prevention bundle, collateral history.
- Red flags demanding rapid escalation: new focal neurologic deficit, fever/hypotension, meningismus, head trauma/anticoagulation use, **GCS drop ≥2**, persistent hypoxemia/hypercapnia, refractory seizures, severe metabolic derangement (pH **<7.2**, K⁺ **≥6.0 mmol/L** with ECG changes).
- Pitfalls: missing hypoglycemia; over‑oxygenating hypercapnic COPD patients (worsening CO₂ narcosis—target **SpO₂ 88–92%**); giving haloperidol in prolonged QT; delaying antibiotics in sepsis; overlooking polypharmacy (anticholinergics, sedatives, baclofen, gabapentinoids); not checking **AMMONIA** in cirrhosis or **TSH** when indicated.
- Imaging: non‑contrast head CT first for bleed/mass; consider C‑spine imaging if trauma; MRI brain when CT non‑diagnostic and suspicion for stroke/encephalitis remains; lumbar puncture after imaging if meningitis/encephalitis suspected—start empiric antimicrobials promptly if high suspicion.
- Labs to send early: CBC, CMP (Na⁺/K⁺/Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺), VBG/ABG, lactate, osmolar gap if toxic alcohols suspected, ammonia, TSH, B12, troponin, UA/urine culture, blood cultures, ethanol, acetaminophen/salicylate levels, urine tox screen.
- Medication issues: hold/adjust CNS depressants and renally cleared drugs in AKI; consider baclofen toxicity in CKD; evaluate for serotonin syndrome (hyperreflexia/clonus) vs neuroleptic malignant syndrome (rigidity, hyperthermia) and treat accordingly.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For CAP‑related sepsis with AMS, follow ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations for empiric coverage based on severity and risk factors; de‑escalate with culture data and treat typical durations (often **5–7 days** if improving).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Transfusion for anemia‑related AMS is rarely emergent unless hemodynamically unstable or with active ischemia; most stable adults use **restrictive thresholds (Hb <7 g/dL)**—individualize to symptoms/ischemia.
- “Confirm Before Proceed” warnings: thrombolysis/anticoagulation reversal, hypertonic saline, lumbar puncture in coagulopathy, and aggressive Na⁺ correction; re‑verify last‑known‑well, anticoagulant use, and current labs before irreversible steps.
- When to call ICU/consults: airway compromise, shock, refractory seizures, deteriorating neuro status, suspected stroke (neurology) or ICH, fulminant hepatic failure (transplant/hepatology), meningitis/encephalitis (ID), toxicology for complex overdoses.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- **GCS ≤8**, persistent airway compromise, or escalating oxygen/ventilation support (need for NIV or intubation).  
- Refractory seizures or **status epilepticus ≥5 min** despite first‑line therapy.  
- Septic shock requiring **norepinephrine ≥0.1–0.2 μg/kg/min** or lactate rising despite resuscitation.  
- Rapidly evolving focal deficit or suspected large‑vessel stroke candidate for thrombectomy.  
- Severe metabolic derangement: pH **<7.2**, K⁺ **≥6.0 mmol/L** with ECG changes, or Na⁺ **<120**/**>160 mmol/L** with symptoms.

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 62‑year‑old man with poorly controlled epilepsy is brought from the ward for unresponsiveness and tonic–clonic movements lasting 6 minutes. Vitals: BP 148/86, HR 112, RR 20, SpO₂ 95% on nasal cannula. He received no medications yet. Bedside glucose is 6.0 mmol/L. Neurologic exam shows ongoing generalized convulsions.

### Options
A. Administer IV dextrose 25 g immediately  
B. Administer IV lorazepam 2 mg, repeat as needed, then load IV levetiracetam 60 mg/kg  
C. Intubate now and start propofol infusion without benzodiazepines  
D. Give IV phenytoin 10 mg/kg as initial therapy  
E. Obtain urgent MRI brain before treatment

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Convulsive status epilepticus requires immediate benzodiazepines (e.g., **lorazepam 2 mg IV**, repeat) followed by a second‑line antiseizure medication such as **levetiracetam 60 mg/kg** if seizures persist; delaying therapy worsens outcomes. MRI should not precede stabilization; phenytoin/fosphenytoin, valproate, or levetiracetam are appropriate second‑line agents, but benzodiazepines come first per the guideline algorithm.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 74‑year‑old woman with atrial fibrillation on apixaban (last dose 3 hours ago) develops acute right‑sided weakness and aphasia 45 minutes after last‑known‑well. BP 168/92, glucose 7.2 mmol/L. Non‑contrast CT head shows no hemorrhage.

### Options
A. Administer IV alteplase now  
B. Withhold IV thrombolysis; urgently evaluate for mechanical thrombectomy and consult neurology  
C. Lower BP to <140/90 before any other intervention  
D. Give full‑dose IV heparin infusion immediately  
E. Delay all therapy pending MRI brain

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Recent factor‑Xa inhibitor use is a contraindication to IV thrombolysis unless specific reversal/lab criteria are met; giving alteplase here risks major bleeding—the pitfall is missing anticoagulant exposure. Proceed with rapid large‑vessel occlusion evaluation for endovascular therapy if eligible; manage blood pressure per stroke protocols.
