# Alcohol Withdrawal

## Panic Card
- Ensure safety and airway: place patient on monitor, **SpO₂ ≥92%**, aspiration precautions, IV access; if severe agitation, use rapid‑acting benzodiazepine (e.g., **diazepam 10–20 mg IV q5–10 min** or **lorazepam 2–4 mg IV q15–20 min**) until calm but arousable.
- Give **thiamine 100–500 mg IV** before glucose if not hypoglycemic; if hypoglycemic, treat with **IV dextrose now**, then thiamine.
- Correct electrolytes early: target **K⁺ ≥4.0 mmol/L**, **Mg²⁺ ≥0.8–1.0 mmol/L (~2.0–2.4 mg/dL)**, **Phos ≥0.8 mmol/L**; recheck frequently.
- If refractory agitation or seizures despite escalating benzodiazepines, give **phenobarbital 130–260 mg IV** (repeat to effect; consider load up to **8–10 mg/kg** in monitored/ICU setting).
- Confirm Before Proceed: before large/stacked sedative doses or phenobarbital loading, confirm airway strategy, end‑tidal CO₂ if available, and exclude severe hepatic encephalopathy or mixed intoxication.

## Brief Overview
- Alcohol withdrawal (AWS) ranges from tremor/anxiety to seizures and delirium tremens (DTs); onset **6–24 h** after last drink, seizures typically **6–48 h**, DTs **48–96 h**. Night‑float priorities are rapid control of autonomic hyperactivity, seizure prevention, nutrition, and electrolyte repletion.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** First‑line therapy is **benzodiazepines** (symptom‑triggered preferred when safely monitored) per **ASAM 2020**; front‑load diazepam for rapid CNS effect or use lorazepam if hepatic impairment.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use structured assessments (e.g., **CIWA‑Ar**) when the patient can participate; for severe agitation/ICU or non‑verbal patients, use **RASS‑targeted** sedation or an ICU protocol (ASAM 2020; SCCM PADIS 2018).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** High‑risk features prompting aggressive therapy/ICU consideration include **history of DTs or withdrawal seizures**, **CIWA‑Ar ≥15–20**, **need for continuous infusion**, or **refractory symptoms** despite adequate benzodiazepines (ASAM 2020).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For benzodiazepine‑refractory AWS, **phenobarbital** (boluses or load **8–10 mg/kg**) is evidence‑supported; **dexmedetomidine** may reduce autonomic hyperactivity as an **adjunct** but does **not** treat the underlying GABA/glutamate imbalance or prevent seizures (ASAM 2020; SCCM PADIS 2018).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Give **parenteral thiamine** to all with moderate–severe AWS or malnutrition; use **200–500 mg IV q8h for 2–3 days** if Wernicke risk, then daily (ASAM 2020).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Avoid **antipsychotic monotherapy**; if needed for hallucinations, use low‑dose haloperidol **2–5 mg** with concurrent benzodiazepine and **QTc monitoring**; antipsychotics lower seizure threshold (ASAM 2020).
- What must happen now: establish monitoring, start benzodiazepine protocol (symptom‑triggered if feasible), administer thiamine and fluids, replete **K/Mg/Phos**, obtain EKG and basic labs (BMP, Mg, Phos, glucose), and rule out mimics (sepsis, hypoglycemia, head injury, hypoxia, hepatic encephalopathy).
- What can wait: long‑term AUD pharmacotherapy (naltrexone/acamprosate), comprehensive counseling, and social work planning once the patient is clinically stable.
- Choose agent/dose: **Diazepam** 10–20 mg IV/PO q5–15 min to effect (long half‑life, fast onset); **Lorazepam** 2–4 mg IV/PO q15–20 min (preferred in cirrhosis/elderly due to glucuronidation); **Chlordiazepoxide** 25–50 mg PO for scheduled tapers if mild–moderate and reliable oral intake.
- Pitfalls: under‑dosing leading to escalation into DTs; stacking multiple sedatives without monitoring; missing **Wernicke encephalopathy** (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, confusion) requiring high‑dose IV thiamine; masking withdrawal with antipsychotics alone; iatrogenic aspiration from oversedation.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use **symptom‑triggered** protocols (e.g., CIWA‑Ar‑based) when staff can assess frequently; use **fixed‑dose with PRN** if assessments are unreliable (ASAM 2020).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** **Seizure management** is benzodiazepines first; avoid phenytoin for AWS seizures unless a separate seizure disorder exists (ASAM 2020).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In ICU, consider **propofol** if intubated and refractory; target light sedation (**RASS 0 to −1**) while preventing recurrence of seizures (SCCM PADIS 2018).
- Electrolytes/nutrition: maintain **K⁺ ≥4.0**, **Mg²⁺ ≥0.8–1.0 mmol/L (~2.0–2.4 mg/dL)**, **Phos ≥0.8 mmol/L**; start multivitamin/folate; consider dextrose‑containing fluids if poor intake, but never delay urgent hypoglycemia treatment for thiamine.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Comorbidities modifying dosing: **cirrhosis, COPD/OSA, elderly, head injury, pregnancy**; in hepatic impairment, prefer lorazepam with careful titration; avoid phenobarbital loads if severe hepatic encephalopathy (ASAM 2020).
- Confirm Before Proceed: before initiating **dexmedetomidine** or **propofol**, ensure a benzodiazepine‑centered regimen is in place and airway/ICU monitoring available; these agents **do not** replace GABAergic therapy.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent severe agitation or autonomic instability despite **≥40–60 mg diazepam equivalents** or need for continuous infusion/adjuncts (dexmedetomidine/propofol).
- **Recurrent seizures**, status epilepticus, or need for airway protection/intubation.
- **CIWA‑Ar ≥20** with inability to safely assess or **RASS ≥+2** despite escalating therapy; hyperthermia **≥39°C**, profound tachycardia **≥140 bpm**, or hypertensive emergency.
- Suspected **Wernicke encephalopathy** or aspiration pneumonia with respiratory compromise; severe metabolic derangements (e.g., **Mg²⁺ <0.5 mmol/L**, **K⁺ <3.0 mmol/L**).

## Orders to Place Now
- Order: Symptom‑triggered benzodiazepine protocol — {agent=diazepam 10–20 mg IV q5–10 min PRN agitation or lorazepam 2–4 mg IV q15–20 min, target=calm but arousable (RASS 0 to −1), reassess=q15–30 min, max_total={institutional}}
- Order: CIWA‑Ar or RASS monitoring — {scale=CIWA‑Ar if cooperative; RASS if non‑verbal/ICU, frequency=q1h until controlled then q4h}
- Order: Thiamine and nutrition repletion — {thiamine=100 mg IV daily (prophylaxis) or 200–500 mg IV q8h x 2–3 days if Wernicke risk, folate=1 mg daily, multivitamin=standard, glucose_protocol=FS q4–6h}
- Order: Electrolyte repletion with targets — {K⁺ target=≥4.0 mmol/L, Mg²⁺ target=≥0.8–1.0 mmol/L, Phos target=≥0.8 mmol/L, labs=BMP/Mg/Phos now and q12–24h}
- Order: Phenobarbital rescue (if refractory) — {dose=130–260 mg IV bolus, repeat to effect, consideration=load up to 8–10 mg/kg in monitored/ICU setting, caution=hepatic encephalopathy/respiratory depression}
- Order: Safety and monitoring — {telemetry=yes, continuous pulse‑ox=yes, seizure precautions=yes, EKG=now, CXR if aspiration concern=yes}

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 52‑year‑old man with severe alcohol use disorder is admitted 12 hours after his last drink with tremor, diaphoresis, HR 120, BP 168/96, and anxiety. He is oriented and cooperative. CIWA‑Ar is 18. Labs show K⁺ 3.4 mmol/L, Mg²⁺ 0.6 mmol/L, glucose 98 mg/dL. What is the best next step?

### Options
A. Start dexmedetomidine infusion and avoid benzodiazepines
B. Start symptom‑triggered benzodiazepine therapy with diazepam 10–20 mg IV to effect and replete electrolytes
C. Administer haloperidol 5 mg IV monotherapy for agitation
D. Begin fixed‑schedule chlordiazepoxide 25 mg PO q6h without PRN doses
E. Load levetiracetam 1,500 mg IV to prevent withdrawal seizures

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
ASAM 2020 recommends **benzodiazepines as first‑line**; symptom‑triggered therapy is preferred when monitoring is available, with diazepam front‑loading for rapid control, alongside **K/Mg repletion**. Dexmedetomidine is an **adjunct** for autonomic symptoms and not monotherapy, antipsychotics alone are contraindicated due to seizure risk, fixed schedules without PRNs risk under‑ or over‑sedation, and antiepileptics like levetiracetam do not prevent AWS seizures.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 58‑year‑old man with alcohol‑related cirrhosis (bilirubin 4.2 mg/dL, INR 1.8) presents 24 hours after last drink with tremor, agitation, and BP 156/92. He is intermittently confused but arousable; ammonia is mildly elevated without asterixis. Which regimen is most appropriate initially?

### Options
A. Diazepam 20 mg IV q5–10 min to large cumulative doses
B. Lorazepam 2–4 mg IV q15–20 min to effect with close monitoring
C. Phenobarbital 10 mg/kg load immediately on the ward
D. Haloperidol 5 mg IV monotherapy for agitation
E. Dexmedetomidine infusion to replace benzodiazepines

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
In hepatic impairment, **lorazepam** (glucuronidation) is preferred over diazepam (oxidative metabolism with active metabolites). Phenobarbital loading should be used cautiously and typically in monitored/ICU settings; antipsychotic monotherapy is unsafe; dexmedetomidine is adjunctive only. The pitfall is using diazepam or barbiturate loads in decompensated liver disease without monitoring.

What changed the decision here?

## Check‑Yourself Micro‑Questions
- Q: What CIWA‑Ar threshold indicates severe withdrawal needing aggressive therapy?  
  A: **≥15–20** is commonly used for severe AWS requiring more intensive dosing/monitoring.
- Q: Preferred benzodiazepine in significant hepatic impairment?  
  A: **Lorazepam** due to glucuronidation and lack of active metabolites.
- Q: Does dexmedetomidine prevent withdrawal seizures?  
  A: No; it is an **adjunct** for autonomic hyperactivity and does not treat the underlying GABA/glutamate imbalance.
- Q: What thiamine dosing is recommended when Wernicke encephalopathy is suspected?  
  A: **200–500 mg IV q8h for 2–3 days**, then daily per ASAM guidance.

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight
- Acute alcohol withdrawal with severity (mild/moderate/severe or DTs) due to chronic alcohol use—objective: HR/BP/Temp, **CIWA‑Ar score**, need for IV/ICU‑level sedatives—treatment: benzodiazepines (agent/doses), adjuncts.
- Alcohol withdrawal seizure(s)—timing relative to last drink, number/duration, response to benzodiazepines—no evidence of alternative seizure etiology if applicable.
- Suspected Wernicke encephalopathy—triad elements present/absent, malnutrition risk—parenteral thiamine dosing and route started.
- Electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia)—lowest values, replacements given, post‑repletion targets.
- Alcohol use disorder (severity per DSM‑5 if assessed)—readiness to change—plan for medications for AUD and follow‑up once medically stable.
