# Shortness of Breath (COPD/ADHF)

## Panic Card
- Sit upright, apply monitored oxygen with clear target: **SpO₂ 88–92% if COPD/hypercapnia risk**; avoid over-oxygenation pending ABG/VBG. **SpO₂ 92–96%** if no hypercapnia risk. Obtain IV access, monitor, ABG/VBG, ECG. citeturn2search31
- Start **noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP/CPAP)** for hypercapnic AECOPD with acidosis or for cardiogenic pulmonary edema with distress/hypoxemia; reassess gas exchange and mental status within 30–60 min. citeturn2search7
- If hypertensive pulmonary edema: give **IV vasodilator (nitroglycerin) with rapid titration** plus NIV if no hypotension; avoid routine morphine. citeturn2search16
- If volume overloaded ADHF: give **IV loop diuretic ~1–2.5× home daily dose (IV equivalent)**; target **net negative** with strict I/O and electrolytes. citeturn2search37
- For suspected AECOPD: **short‑acting bronchodilator nebs (albuterol + ipratropium)** and **systemic steroids (prednisone 40 mg PO daily x5 d or methylprednisolone 40 mg IV daily if NPO)**. citeturn2search20

## Brief Overview
- Shortness of breath overnight often reflects two high‑risk clusters: acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Distinguishing features overlap; bedside ultrasound (B‑lines vs hyperinflation), natriuretic peptides, and ABG/VBG help triage and guide therapy without delaying stabilization. citeturn2search16
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In suspected or known COPD, titrate oxygen to **SpO₂ 88–92%** to avoid oxygen‑induced hypercapnia; record the prescribed target on vitals flowsheets and reassess after gases return. citeturn2search31turn2search32
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Initiate **NIV** for AECOPD with **pH ≤7.35 and hypercapnia** or for cardiogenic pulmonary edema with persistent distress/hypoxemia; NIV reduces intubation and improves outcomes when applied with close monitoring and failure criteria. citeturn2search7
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For AECOPD, give **systemic corticosteroids** (e.g., **prednisone 40 mg PO daily for 5 days**) to shorten recovery and improve FEV₁; use **short‑acting bronchodilators** (albuterol ± ipratropium) as first‑line relievers. citeturn2search20
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Consider **antibiotics** in AECOPD when increased dyspnea, sputum purulence, and/or volume are present or when ventilatory support is required. Tailor to local resistance and severity. citeturn2search20
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** In ADHF with congestion, use **IV loop diuretic** early (typical starting dose **~2–2.5× the outpatient PO daily dose as IV** for those on chronic diuretics; 40–80 mg IV furosemide BID if diuretic‑naïve) and adjust within 2 hours by urine response. citeturn2search37
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For **hypertensive pulmonary edema**, add **IV vasodilator (nitroglycerin)** to rapidly reduce preload/afterload and relieve dyspnea; pair with NIV if no contraindication; avoid routine morphine due to harm signals. citeturn2search16
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use **natriuretic peptides (BNP/NT‑proBNP)** and **echocardiography** to confirm heart‑failure physiology and guide early management; integrate with clinical exam and imaging, not as sole arbiters. citeturn2search16
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Re‑initiate or optimize guideline‑directed medical therapy (as hemodynamics permit) before discharge in ADHF, but avoid starting/uptitrating vasodilatory agents during shock/hypotension. citeturn2search16
- What must happen now: stabilize airway/breathing, set explicit **SpO₂** targets, decide on **NIV** vs intubation criteria, give bronchodilators and steroids for AECOPD, administer IV diuretic ± vasodilator for ADHF, and establish monitoring (telemetry, strict I/O, serial gases). citeturn2search7turn2search16
- What can wait (after stabilization): comprehensive differential (PE, pneumonia, ACS, arrhythmia), inhaler education and device technique, vaccination counseling, sleep‑disordered breathing evaluation, and longitudinal HF optimization. citeturn2search16
- Pitfalls: over‑oxygenation of COPD leading to CO₂ narcosis; under‑dosing initial IV loop diuretic causing diuretic resistance; delayed NIV in acidemic hypercapnia; failure to add vasodilator in hypertensive pulmonary edema; reflexive morphine use in ADHF. citeturn2search31turn2search37turn2search7turn2search16
- Call ICU early for refractory hypoxemia/hypercapnia, shock, escalating NIV settings, or need for continuous vasodilators/pressors; involve cardiology/pulmonology for complex physiology, arrhythmias, or unclear etiology. citeturn2search7turn2search16
- Disposition pearls: floor candidates need stable oxygen/NIV settings and improving diuresis; step‑down/ICU for frequent NIV adjustments, vasodilator drips, or concerning acidosis/encephalopathy. citeturn2search7turn2search16

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent **pH <7.30**, rising PaCO₂, or worsening encephalopathy despite NIV and bronchodilators. citeturn2search7
- **Refractory hypoxemia** (e.g., **SpO₂ <88%** on high‑flow/NIV) or hemodynamic instability/shock. citeturn2search7

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 68‑year‑old man with severe COPD presents with acute dyspnea, wheeze, and somnolence. Vitals: BP 148/82 mmHg, HR 112, RR 28, SpO₂ 96% on nonrebreather. ABG: pH 7.28, PaCO₂ 72 mmHg, PaO₂ 82 mmHg. CXR without focal consolidation. He received albuterol/ipratropium nebs en route.

### Options
A. Continue high‑flow oxygen targeting SpO₂ 98–100% and reassess in 2 hours  
B. Start BiPAP and titrate oxygen to SpO₂ 88–92%  
C. Immediate endotracheal intubation and volume control ventilation  
D. Give IV morphine 2 mg for dyspnea relief  
E. Begin IV acetazolamide 500 mg for metabolic alkalosis

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
In acidemic hypercapnic AECOPD, **NIV** is first‑line and reduces intubation/mortality; oxygen should be **titrated to 88–92%** to avoid worsening CO₂ retention. Intubate if NIV fails or contraindicated. Morphine is not recommended for routine dyspnea management here. citeturn2search7turn2search31

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 72‑year‑old woman with chronic HFrEF on furosemide 40 mg PO BID presents with sudden severe dyspnea and pink frothy sputum after missing antihypertensives. BP 220/110 mmHg, HR 118, RR 32, SpO₂ 86% on 6 L NC; JVP elevated, diffuse rales. You consider giving only IV furosemide and waiting for effect.

### Options
A. Start BiPAP and **IV nitroglycerin infusion with rapid up‑titration**, plus IV loop diuretic  
B. Give IV morphine and low‑dose IV fluids to “improve renal perfusion,” reassess later  
C. Trial oxygen by nasal cannula only; avoid NIV due to aspiration risk  
D. Start IV beta‑blocker for tachycardia before afterload reduction  
E. Hold all therapies until BNP results return

### Correct answer
A

### Rationale
Hypertensive flash pulmonary edema benefits from **early NIV** and **rapid‑titration IV nitroglycerin** to unload the heart, alongside loop diuretic; withholding vasodilator or relying on morphine/fluids is harmful. The pitfall is **under‑treating hypertensive pulmonary edema** by using diuretics alone and delaying vasodilator/NIV. citeturn2search7turn2search16
