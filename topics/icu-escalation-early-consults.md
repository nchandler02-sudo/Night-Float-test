# ICU Escalation & Early Consults

## Panic Card
- Assess airway, breathing, circulation; place on monitor; two large-bore IVs; start crystalloid bolus if hypotensive; target **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; apply O₂ to keep **SpO₂ ≥90%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia).
- If hypotension persists after fluids or lactate **≥4 mmol/L**, start **norepinephrine** and titrate to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; obtain **lactate now and q2–4 h**.
- For impending/actual respiratory failure (work of breathing, **SpO₂ <90%** on supplemental O₂, or **PaO₂/FiO₂ <150**), escalate support (HFNC/NIV) and page ICU now.
- Treat immediately reversible threats: **glucose <3.0 mmol/L** → IV dextrose; **K⁺ ≥6.0 mmol/L with ECG changes** → IV calcium, then insulin/dextrose and removal strategy; control active massive bleeding.
- Call appropriate stat consults early for time-critical paths (stroke door-to-needle **≤4.5 h**, STEMI, massive PE, airway obstruction); Confirm Before Proceed for irreversible steps (e.g., thrombolysis, MTP activation).

## Brief Overview
- Night-float escalation hinges on early recognition of decompensation in airway, breathing, circulation, mental status, or uncontrolled bleeding; act fast and call for help early while stabilizing ABCs with objective targets (**MAP ≥65 mmHg**, **SpO₂ ≥90%**, **glucose >3.0 mmol/L**). 
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Sepsis bundle initial steps per Surviving Sepsis 2021: prompt recognition, cultures, early broad-spectrum antibiotics, **30 mL/kg balanced crystalloid** for hypotension or **lactate ≥4 mmol/L**, and **norepinephrine** as first-line vasopressor to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Shock escalation to ICU when vasopressor is required, lactate remains elevated, or there is persistent hypotension despite fluids; arterial line strongly considered for invasive monitoring in ongoing shock.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with **SpO₂ <90%** despite supplemental O₂, rising work of breathing, or **PaO₂/FiO₂ <150** should trigger ICU evaluation and trial of HFNC/NIV with close monitoring; intubate for failing NIV, altered mental status, or inability to protect airway.
- Objective ventilatory failure signs (worsening hypercapnia, acidosis, exhaustion) are high-risk at night; NIV is helpful in COPD/CHF exacerbations but failure criteria mandate swift intubation planning with ICU.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** AHA/ASA stroke pathways prioritize immediate imaging and thrombolysis within **≤4.5 h** when eligible; any new focal neuro deficit with disabling symptoms or deteriorating mental status requires emergent neurology involvement and likely ICU if airway/ICP risk.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guidance supports ICU transfer for cardiogenic shock (hypotension, cold extremities, rising lactate, worsening renal function) and initiation of inotropes/vasopressors with invasive monitoring.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** AABB 2023 advocates a **restrictive RBC threshold of Hb <7 g/dL** in most stable adults; ICU/consult early for active bleeding with hemodynamic instability or signs of shock; platelets if severe thrombocytopenia with bleeding.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** ATS/IDSA CAP criteria: severe pneumonia (major criteria like septic shock or respiratory failure requiring ventilation; or ≥3 minor criteria) warrants ICU; monitor for escalating O₂ needs, hypotension, or confusion.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** KDIGO AKI: Stage 2–3 AKI, refractory hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, or volume overload with hypoxemia are dialysis/ICU triggers; consult nephrology early when potassium is **≥6.0 mmol/L**, pH **<7.2**, or uremic complications.
- Time-sensitive consults that should not wait until morning: acute stroke, STEMI/NSTEMI with instability, GI bleed with hemodynamic compromise, massive PE suspicion, status epilepticus, airway lesions, compartment syndrome, and threatened limb ischemia.
- What must happen now: stabilize ABCs; obtain critical labs (lactate, ABG/VBG, BMP/CBC/Coags, type & screen), portable CXR, ECG; start guideline-concordant therapy (antibiotics for sepsis within 1 h, vasopressors for shock, HFNC/NIV for hypoxemia, insulin for DKA/HHS); notify ICU/appropriate consultants early.
- What can wait a few hours: non-urgent medication reconciliation, non-critical imaging, and specialist follow-up for stable, improving patients; however, document rationale and contingency plans if deferring steps overnight.
- Pitfalls: under-recognizing occult shock (normal BP but **lactate ≥4 mmol/L** or skin mottling), delaying antibiotics, over-oxygenation in COPD (target **SpO₂ 88–92%**), missing silent airway compromise (stridor, drooling, neck swelling), and failing to reassess response q15–30 min.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Use norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor in septic and undifferentiated shock; add vasopressin if escalating requirements; avoid dopamine due to arrhythmias except in select bradycardic shock.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For suspected upper GI bleed with hypotension, resuscitate, start IV PPI, consider octreotide if variceal risk, correct coagulopathy, and call GI early; transfuse RBCs at **Hb <7 g/dL** or earlier if massive hemorrhage and shock; activate MTP as indicated (Confirm Before Proceed).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** For DKA/HHS, initiate insulin infusion after confirming **K⁺ ≥3.3 mmol/L**; ICU for severe acidosis (pH **<7.0–7.1**), altered mental status, or need for insulin infusion and close titration; vigilantly correct electrolytes and avoid rapid sodium shifts.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Need for vasopressor to maintain **MAP ≥65 mmHg**, **lactate ≥4 mmol/L**, or persistent hypotension after guideline-volume resuscitation.
- Respiratory failure with **SpO₂ <90%** on high-flow O₂, **PaO₂/FiO₂ <150**, escalating work of breathing, or NIV intolerance/failure.
- Acute neurologic decline (new focal deficit, seizures, GCS drop) or airway protection concern in intracranial pathology.
- Massive/ongoing bleeding with hemodynamic instability, **Hb falling toward <7 g/dL**, or transfusion requirement anticipated; consider MTP.
- Hyperkalemia **≥6.0 mmol/L** with ECG changes, severe acidosis **pH <7.2**, or refractory volume overload requiring emergent renal replacement therapy.

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 67-year-old man with diabetes and COPD is admitted with fever and productive cough. On the night shift he is tachypneic (RR 32), tachycardic (110), BP 88/52 after 2 L balanced crystalloids, SpO₂ 90% on 6 L nasal cannula, and lactate is 4.6 mmol/L. He is alert but dyspneic with accessory muscle use. 

### Options
A. Switch to dopamine as first-line vasopressor and wait for morning ICU rounds  
B. Start norepinephrine now and request ICU evaluation for shock and respiratory failure  
C. Increase nasal cannula to 10 L and give a third liter before any vasopressor  
D. Intubate immediately without trial of noninvasive support  
E. Start antibiotics after repeat lactate confirms persistence at 6 hours

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale
Per Surviving Sepsis 2021, persistent hypotension or **lactate ≥4 mmol/L** after fluid resuscitation warrants early **norepinephrine** to target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** and ICU-level care; antibiotics should be given within 1 hour of recognition. HFNC/NIV may be trialed while preparing for possible intubation; dopamine is inferior due to arrhythmia risk.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 74-year-old woman with CKD stage 4 presents with confusion and dyspnea. Vitals: BP 92/58, HR 102, RR 28, SpO₂ 88% on 4 L NC. Labs: K⁺ 6.2 mmol/L with peaked T-waves, bicarbonate 13 mmol/L, creatinine 3.2 mg/dL (baseline 2.1), lactate 2.5 mmol/L. After 1 L balanced crystalloid, BP remains 90/56. 

### Options
A. Give additional 2 L crystalloid before any other intervention  
B. Start vasopressin as first-line pressor  
C. Administer IV calcium, insulin with dextrose, start norepinephrine to **MAP ≥65**, and request ICU and nephrology consults  
D. Delay ICU consult until morning because lactate is not elevated  
E. Observe on the floor after placing on 6 L NC

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
The pitfall is under-triaging hyperkalemic, acidotic patients with CKD who have relative hypotension but lactate not markedly elevated. Immediate membrane stabilization (IV calcium) and potassium shift/removal plus **norepinephrine** for hypotension meet ICU criteria; early nephrology involvement is indicated given **K⁺ ≥6.0 mmol/L** and acidosis.
