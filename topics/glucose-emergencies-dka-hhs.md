# Glucose Emergencies (DKA/HHS)

## Panic Card
- Secure airway/breathing; give oxygen for hypoxemia; start isotonic crystalloid bolus now; target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** if shock. citeturn2search3
- Check potassium urgently; **do not start insulin if K⁺ <3.3 mmol/L**—replete first. citeturn2search3turn2search2
- Start IV regular insulin **0.1 units/kg/h** (DKA) or **0.05 units/kg/h** (HHS) once K⁺ ≥3.3 mmol/L and volume resuscitation underway. citeturn2search3turn2search7
- Add dextrose when glucose reaches **~200 mg/dL (DKA)** or **~250–300 mg/dL (HHS)** to continue insulin safely. citeturn2search3turn2search11
- Obtain VBG, β‑hydroxybutyrate, serum osmolality; monitor glucose hourly and BMP (including Mg/Phos) every 2–4 h. citeturn2search3turn2search32

## Brief Overview
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** DKA = hyperglycemia, ketosis, metabolic acidosis; HHS = severe hyperglycemia with hyperosmolality and minimal ketosis/acidosis; mixed states occur and follow the predominant physiology. citeturn2search3
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Start with isotonic fluids (0.9% saline or balanced crystalloid) for intravascular resuscitation, then adjust rate/type by hemodynamics and corrected sodium; typical ongoing rate 250–500 mL/h. citeturn2search3turn2search11
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Potassium is the gate: **K⁺ <3.3 mmol/L → hold insulin and replete**; **3.3–5.2 → add 20–30 mmol K⁺/L to fluids**; **>5.2 → no K⁺ yet, recheck frequently**. citeturn2search3turn2search2
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Insulin dosing—IV regular insulin **0.1 units/kg/h** for DKA (no bolus required in most adults); for HHS or frail patients consider **0.05 units/kg/h**. citeturn2search3turn2search7
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** When glucose falls to **~200 mg/dL (DKA)** or **~250–300 mg/dL (HHS)**, add dextrose and continue insulin to clear ketones/normalize osmolality. citeturn2search3turn2search11
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Preferred labs/monitoring: VBG (arterial not required), capillary glucose **q1h**, BMP with Mg/Phos **q2–4h**, β‑hydroxybutyrate for diagnosis/resolution; hourly I/O and mental status. citeturn2search28turn2search32
- DKA resolution (examples from consensus): closed anion gap with rising bicarbonate/venous pH and normalization of β‑hydroxybutyrate; HHS resolution includes improved mentation with **effective osmolality <320 mOsm/kg** and adequate hydration. citeturn2search3
- Typical glucose fall targets are **~50–75 mg/dL per hour**; insufficient fall prompts reassessment of volume status and possible temporary insulin rate increase. citeturn2search12
- Add dextrose using D5 0.45% NaCl (or D5 NS if hyponatremic) to maintain **glucose 150–200 mg/dL (DKA)** or **~200–250 mg/dL (HHS)** until resolution. citeturn2search3turn2search11
- Identify/treat precipitants: infection, MI, stroke, pancreatitis, insulin omission, steroid therapy, and **SGLT2 inhibitor–associated euglycemic DKA** (normal or mildly elevated glucose). citeturn2search3
- Bicarbonate: generally **avoid** in adults unless **pH ≤6.9**, then consider cautious buffered replacement with close K⁺ monitoring; evidence for benefit is limited/controversial. citeturn2search16
- HHS fluids: aim for gradual osmolality decline (**~3–8 mOsm/kg/h**) to reduce cerebral edema risk; prioritize volume first, then insulin at lower rates. citeturn2search11
- Transition off IV insulin only after DKA/HHS resolution and when patient can eat; **overlap basal insulin by 1–2 h** before stopping infusion. citeturn2search32
- Night pitfalls: starting insulin before checking K⁺; aggressive fluids in CHF/ESRD without hemodynamic monitoring; failing to add dextrose early enough; missing mixed DKA/HHS with anion gap plus **effective osmolality ≥320**. citeturn2search3turn2search11
- Consult early for refractory acidosis, shock, or altered mental status; consider ICU for insulin titration and electrolyte shifts requiring q1–2h labs. citeturn2search3
- ADA 2026 Hospital Standards reinforce protocolized inpatient pathways for hyperglycemic crises, CGM/pump considerations, and safe transitions of care. citeturn2search20turn2search21

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers
- Persistent hypotension despite fluids or need for vasopressors; rising lactate or suspected sepsis. citeturn2search3
- Severe acidosis **pH <7.0** or refractory anion‑gap acidosis despite insulin/fluids. citeturn2search3
- **Effective osmolality ≥330 mOsm/kg** or rapidly changing osmolality with worsening mental status. citeturn2search11
- K⁺ instability (**<3.0** or **>6.0 mmol/L**) or life‑threatening arrhythmias. citeturn2search3
- Respiratory failure, coma, or need for q1h titration with multi‑organ dysfunction. citeturn2search3

## ABIM‑Style Question 1

### Stem
A 28‑year‑old with type 1 diabetes presents with polyuria, Kussmaul respirations, and nausea. Vitals: BP 102/64, HR 118. Labs: glucose 540 mg/dL, β‑hydroxybutyrate elevated, VBG pH 7.13, HCO₃⁻ 10 mmol/L, anion gap 24, K⁺ 2.9 mmol/L, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL. After 1 L of 0.9% saline, next best step?

### Options
A. Begin IV regular insulin at 0.1 units/kg/h now  
B. Give sodium bicarbonate infusion  
C. Administer 20–30 mmol KCl in IV fluids and hold insulin until K⁺ ≥3.3 mmol/L  
D. Start D5 0.45% NaCl and IV insulin concurrently  
E. Give subcutaneous rapid‑acting insulin 10 units and repeat in 1 h

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale
Insulin drives K⁺ intracellularly and can precipitate arrhythmia when **K⁺ <3.3 mmol/L**; therefore potassium must be repleted before starting insulin. citeturn2search3 Fluid resuscitation precedes insulin, and bicarbonate is generally reserved for **pH ≤6.9**. citeturn2search3turn2search16

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 62‑year‑old with type 2 diabetes on empagliflozin returns 24 h after laparoscopic cholecystectomy with malaise and vomiting. Vitals: BP 118/70, HR 110. Labs: glucose 184 mg/dL, β‑hydroxybutyrate 4.2 mmol/L, VBG pH 7.24, HCO₃⁻ 16 mmol/L, anion gap 18, K⁺ 4.3 mmol/L. What is the best management?

### Options
A. Discharge with antiemetics; glucose <200 mg/dL  
B. Give IV bicarbonate to correct acidosis  
C. Start IV fluids only; avoid insulin because glucose <250 mg/dL  
D. Initiate DKA protocol: isotonic fluids, IV insulin 0.1 units/kg/h, and early dextrose to allow insulin continuation; stop SGLT2 inhibitor  
E. Start subcutaneous sliding‑scale insulin only

### Correct answer
D

### Rationale
This is **euglycemic DKA** associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use; treatment mirrors DKA with insulin plus dextrose to clear ketones despite near‑normal glucose. citeturn2search3 Bicarbonate is not indicated unless **pH ≤6.9**; fluids alone or sliding‑scale insulin are inadequate. citeturn2search16

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight
- Acute diabetic ketoacidosis vs hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: specify acuity, mixed DKA/HHS if present; include objective criteria (β‑hydroxybutyrate, pH/HCO₃⁻, anion gap, **effective osmolality**).  
- Etiology/trigger: infection, MI, medication nonadherence, SGLT2 inhibitor, steroid exposure; link to crisis.  
- Severity/organ dysfunction: hypotension/shock, altered mental status, AKI, electrolyte derangements (K⁺, Phos, Mg).  
- Treatment/response: type/volume of fluids, insulin infusion rate, potassium repletion, dextrose addition, monitoring frequency, ICU involvement.  
- Risk/safety statements: “K⁺ corrected to **≥3.3 mmol/L** before insulin,” osmolality change monitored, and if bicarbonate used, document **pH ≤6.9** indication. citeturn2search3turn2search16
